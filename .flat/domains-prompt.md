_Step 1 (Conceptualization):_

Prompt: I'm trying to decide on a name for my generative design app. I'm stuck between kern.app, bezier.io, bezi.design, and bezi.ai. I'm open to other suggestions as well. Could you help me decide on a name? Please consider a variety of factors such as memorability, uniqueness, simplicity, etc

_Step 2 (Evaluation):_

Prompt: For each of the options proposed, evaluate their potential. Consider their pros and cons, initial effort needed, implementation difficulty, potential challenges, and the expected outcomes. Assign a probability of success and a confidence level to each option based on these factors

_Step 3 (Expansion):_

Prompt: For each solution, deepen the thought process. Generate potential scenarios, strategies for implementation, any necessary partnerships or resources, and how potential obstacles might be overcome. Also, consider any potential unexpected outcomes and how they might be handled.

_Step 4 (Decision):_

Prompt: Based on the evaluations and scenarios, rank the solutions in order of promise. Provide a justification for each ranking and offer any final thoughts or considerations for each solution
