I'm feeling impatient and thinking about end user programming.

is it the design of a product that makes it the best at whaat it does? can a product truly be the best at what it does for everyone?

is unity the best at what it does? is unity's end user the developer or the person playing the game?

we want to build a general purpose highly hackable open source tool for making tools.

it will be simple to learn, and exhilarating to master.

it will be highly visual, and highly interactive.
