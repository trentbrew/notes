This document outlines the pricing model for Webflow detailing both Site Plans and Workspace Plans. It can be used as a reference to facilitate budgeting and planning for any Webflow projects in the future and should provide some clarity on the cost structure. Let me know if there are any improvements I can make or anything I can simplify. I'm happy to help!

Hi Rebecca –

 

I’m connecting you here with Trent, who will be the web designer/developer moving on this next contract with SPEAK. He’s offered sometime this week (pre official Kick-Off for the project) to support some of the immediate needs you’re hoping to sort out on the site, which all sound quite small and simple, though impactful.

Connecting you directly so you can communicate accordingly and get going on finding times that work this week.

 

Please keep me looped in via Cc so that I can support any needs as they arise and can relay to Sierra, our PM for this project, what work has already transpired by the time we officially launch on the 9th.

Thanks!

Thank you for the introduction, Matthew!

Trent- Nice to e-meet you. I am very open to what works best for you to meet. 
Here's my schedule:
Thursday- anytime after 1pm CST
Friday- anytime after Noon CST
I would say that 1 hour would be sufficient to meet virtually, and then we could correspond over email to finalize the website updates.
Looking forward to working together!

It's a pleasure to e-meet you as well! I'm excited to contribute to the SPEAK MPLS project and Matthew has briefed me on the scope. I'm eager to discuss further details with you and will be available anytime Friday afternoon.

PREVIEW
As a preview, we will want to make these changes in real-time:
Change our Team listing on ABOUT page to remove two people and add two new people. I will have those assets ready tomorrow.
Remove double footer on ABOUT page
Duplicate THIS existing page to create a new one with THIS COPY. We'll have new assets to switch out, and can fill in the copy on our own with your guidance.
Change top bar from 2023 Summer Media Camp to 2023-2024 RYSE MPLS Story Lab and then link to the new page created.
Other things may come up, but that's what we have so far.
Thank you so much!

Hi Rebecca,

Thank you for sending over the Webflow login. 2pm CST works great for me, and I'd be happy to make any of the changes outlined in your previous email prior to our call if that would be helpful.

Looking forward to connecting!

Hi Trent,

Making them in advance would be great!
We are still working on the exact copy for the duplicate page, but we can edit that when it’s finalized tomorrow. 

Would you like me to send a Zoom link?

Hi Rebecca,

I'll adjust what I can in the meantime and look forward to the final copy tomorrow. A Zoom link would be great, thank you!

Good morning Rebecca,

Just a heads up that I will be needing access to the following Canva asset: Request access - Canva
Regarding the https://www.speakmpls.com/rysestorylab page, I do have some questions regarding the CMS structure of the site and want to make sure things are correct and consistent. I'll be sure to bring these up during our call this afternoon. Looking forward to 

– Trent
