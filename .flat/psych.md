Hello Trent,

Good day and thank you for reaching out to our office.

This is Christia and I am responding on behalf of Dr. Adimorah.

I tried calling your number twice but there was no answer.

Currently, she is on leave until January 12, 2024.

In the meantime, I can book you an initial appointment with one of our available providers.

The earliest available schedule is on December 19, 2023.

Would you like to proceed?

Kind Regards,

Christia
