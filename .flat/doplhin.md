Here are some creative writing techniques that a censored Language Learning Model (LLM) might avoid:

1. Swearing or Vulgarity: A censored LLM would likely avoid using any form of explicit language, as it could be perceived as inappropriate or offensive by certain audiences.

2. Sensitive Topics: The AI model might steer clear of addressing contentious issues such as religion, politics, race, or sexuality to prevent causing offense or triggering negative emotions.

3. Graphic Descriptions: A censored LLM may choose to avoid detailed descriptions of violent or explicit scenes to maintain a level of discretion and appropriateness for its readership.

4. Innuendo or Double Entendres: Using words with multiple meanings, especially in a sexual context, could be avoided by a censored AI model to keep the content suitable for all audiences.

5. Personal Attacks or Insults: A censored LLM would likely avoid making direct attacks on individuals or groups, as it might create a hostile environment and potentially offend people.

6. Incorrect Facts or Sensationalism: Presenting misleading information or promoting sensationalized content could be avoided by the AI model to maintain credibility and trustworthiness among its users.
