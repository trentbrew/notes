Hey! Sorry to hit you up over the holidays. Quick question. Generally, do you feel comfortable taking on SEO and Google Ads work? Do you have a model for this?

Hey Matthew, while I may not have a model in place or immediate expertise in SEO or Google Ads, I'm enthusiastic about learning and expanding my skills in these areas. I found some resources and certifications through Google Skillshop. I can pursue these to get up to speed and begin training if it would be helpful.
Regarding your email on workflow updates, I'm definitely interested in being more heavily prioritized for future work with Gumbo. I'm happy to be a generalist that floats between graphic/web design, and it's an honor to be considered as one of the primary digital designers :bow::skin-tone-5: I'm happy to contribute in whatever capacity is most helpful to you and the team.

Awesome, thanks, Trent! I have a client asking about the SEO work, so I’m trying to sort out whether or not it makes sense to take it on now. I’ll give it a think and get back to you, as both you and Cassandra said the same thing.
I’ll be in touch!

Hi Matthew,

I hope you're well. Thank you for the holiday wishes and for the updates heading into January. I'm excited to get back into the swing of things and wanted to let you know that I've been doing a ton of research into SEO over the break. I'm feeling much more confident with my understanding of the topic and I've been working to integrate it into the writing app MVP which I'm excited to share as soon as it's ready.

Baking SEO into the app has been a great learning experience, and I think I'm in a place where I'm comfortable applying the same model to real-world projects. I'd be happy to continue learning and applying these skills for any clients that are interested in SEO work.

Let me know if there's anything at all I can do to help out this week.

Cheers,
Trent
