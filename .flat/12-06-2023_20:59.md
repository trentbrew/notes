**Brand Identity Summary:**

**Mission:**
The brand is geared towards creating and helping businesses to establish the best working environment for their employees. With a dedication to "servant leadership," the brand seeks to inspire and uplift both corporations and individuals. The brand has a strong community and world-oriented perspective, aiming to be knowledgeable, experienced, trustworthy, authentic, honest, and people-driven【9†source】【10†source】.

**Target Audience:**
The target audience is defined as individuals between the ages of 18-65, belonging to the new generation of Gen X and Y, ranging from corporate professionals and executives to students interested in the servant leadership space. These individuals are characterized by their mission-driven mindsets, cultural consciousness, desire to serve the world, interest in creating people-first work environments, and genuine care for others【17†source】.

Specifically, three personas are described in detail:

2. Matthew Thomas: A C-Suite Executive who is seeking to improve his organization and adapt to more people-driven company values.

- Focus on themes of servant leadership, cultural perspicacity, and community orientation.
- Address the target audience with specificity, tailoring the language to different personas.
- Ensure the visual elements convey warmth, approachability, and are inviting.
