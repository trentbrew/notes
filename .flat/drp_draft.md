Hi Dr. Ashley,

Thank you again for your patience. I wanted to follow up with you regarding our arrangement and my working relationship with Gumbo Media.

I spoke with Matthew and the Ops team on Monday, and after careful consideration, we've agreed that it would be best for your retainer to be managed directly through Gumbo Media. This change means you'll have access to a broader range of resources and support, broadening the services available to you and ensuring the best outcome for The Rolling Archives.

While this shift might alter the original pricing structure slightly, I am confident that the enhanced value and support from Gumbo's team will be a significant benefit. I'll still be working with you direcrtly to provide technical support, and I believe the additional resources and support available through Gumbo will be invaluable.

I understand that your request for a contract is time-sensitive, and I'll be working with the team to get that to you as soon as possible. I'm committed to ensuring a smooth transition and ongoing success for The Rolling Archives, and as always, I'm available to answer any questions you may have, so please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks again for your patience and understanding, and I look forward to your response.

Warm regards,
Trent
