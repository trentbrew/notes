The introduction of AI has disrupted the traditional ways of SEO, and new strategies must be implemented to stay ahead of competitors. The use of chat GPT has made it easier to create SEO content at scale, leading to an influx of poorly written, generic, and robot-like content flooding the internet. Google's new search experience, which provides AI-generated answers, has also caused concern among SEO experts. However, AI-powered SEO can be future-proofed by adding a human perspective to the content. Using chat GPT to generate a list of semantically relevant but unique topics is the first step in creating a topical map that establishes a website as an authority in its niche. Outlines can then be created in seconds, and with the addition of a unique perspective, the content can sound like it was written by a person. By infusing AI-generated content with a human perspective, it is possible to create compelling and informative content that connects with readers and ranks well in search results.
