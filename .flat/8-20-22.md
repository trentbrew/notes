Good morning Ali, I am okay. I recently started a new job and realized I have overbooked.

I wasn't sure whether to reach out to you or the instructor, but I realize that this cannot happen again, and that the structure of the class depends on having an accurate & reliable count of mentors/students. I am not taking this lightly, and I deeply apologize to you, the other mentors, the instructor, and especially the students for my gross mishandling of this new schedule.

I believe online classes will be more attainable in the future, but just to be certain, I would like to try and register as close to the start of the class as possible. What is the soonest a mentor might be able to register before the start of a class?

I feel very lucky to have discovered We All Code. It is a pillar of my life that I take very seriously and whether or not I remain in the Chicago area I plan to contribute however possible.
I plan to attend CSS 101 on September 20th, and I have a friend in the data science field who I am hoping to bring along to the Python class on August 27th. I will be sure to reach out early if there are conflicts.
I'm humbled to work with you and your organization, and thank you so much for allowing me to be a part of it.
