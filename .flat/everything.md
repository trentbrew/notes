# ABOUT NEWROOT

---

NewRoot is a national social impact organization that focuses on nurturing people and cultivating restorative learning spaces[1][2]. Formerly known as Umoja Student Development Corporation, NewRoot has been working for over 20 years to transform the way young people experience school and how schools serve society[5].

The organization's primary focus is on building deep social-emotional learning (SEL) skills in educators[5]. They achieve this through several key initiatives:

1. Professional learning and adult accountability: NewRoot provides training, workshops, consultation, and coaching to help schools and districts implement whole-school SEL approaches[2].
2. Accredited Seminar curriculum: They offer an equity-centered Tier 1 MTSS approach to post-secondary preparation, transition, and academic reflection[2].
3. Restorative justice structures and practices: NewRoot established peace rooms in schools to change school culture and provide students with safe spaces to process feelings and conflicts[2].
4. Self-awareness and contextual thinking: They help partners shift to restorative mindsets and create school environments where students' realities are seen, heard, and considered[2].

NewRoot partners with schools and districts to develop customized solutions that address social-emotional wellness, equity, and restorative justice[2]. Their approach involves:

1. Consultation to understand partners' needs
2. Wellness checks and assessments
3. Collaborative strategy development
4. Implementation of learning and coaching cycles
5. Measuring skill development, implementation, and impact[3]

The organization's work is guided by core values such as community, curiosity, dignity, relationship, and radical love[2]. NewRoot aims to have a lasting impact on young people by helping them explore post-secondary options, develop critical thinking skills, and prepare for college, career, and life success[2][5].

**Hello team üëãüèæ,**

Thank you for the introduction, @Matthew Manning. I'll be on the lookout for the WordPress login information. Please feel free to add any additional information to the portal as needed, and I'll be here to answer any questions you may have.

Looking forward to working with you all, and have a great weekend!

**Hi NewRoot team!**

I‚Äôd like to introduce you to Trent Brew. While we‚Äôre finalizing signing for contracts, I figured we could get started with services at the top of next week given the short timeline. With our history and relationship to NewRoot over the years, we feel comfortable speeding up the process.

As I will be out next week, I am connecting you directly with Trent so we can get started at the top of next week. Please use THIS folder to (re)relay your needs, login info for the website and portal, as well as the necessary WordPress login info. If Trent deems it helpful or necessary to book a call and get deeper context/detail, he will do so. I‚Äôve added the baseline context written into the scope, but please add more detail around the addition to the portal, when you have a free moment.

I will also be reachable by email for the remainder of the day if any questions come up.

Thanks, team!

**Matthew Phillips-Manning (he/him)**

I want to let the client (NewRoot) know that I was able to get into 3 out of 4 of the accounts. The Natwork solutions login requires a verification code (see attached), but I reckon we can sync over a call to make sure we're all set to gather any other needs from the client that arent alreadt specified in @needs.md ‚Äì I want to let them know that I'm available as early as tomorrow or anytime after 11am this week. I want them to know I am flexible. I want to check with them whether they would like to sync over a call before I begin the website updates, or if I should go ahead and begin making updates ahead of time.
