Hi Dr. Erin,

I hope you're doing swell!

Our team has put together four Squarespace template options for your review:

1. [Option 1](https://erin-d-chapman-1.squarespace.com)
2. [Option 2](https://erin-d-chapman-2.squarespace.com)
3. [Option 3](https://erin-d-chapman-3.squarespace.com)
4. [Option 4](https://erin-d-chapman-4.squarespace.com)

I've invited you as a contributor to each of these templates via your email (erin.d.chapman@gmail.com). This will allow you to access and explore the designs in detail. Please keep in mind that these are just initial concepts and can be customized to better fit your brand and personal style. Other pages (about, contact, etc) will be added once we finalize the design direction and photography.

As you review the templates, please share your thoughts and feedback. Let me know what elements you like, dislike, or if there are specific features from one template you'd like to see incorporated into another. I'm particularly interested in your opinions on the overall design, color usage, and any content you feel is missing or should be showcased on the site.

Additionally, considering the distinctive design of your book cover for "Prove It On Me," I wonder if there are elements from that process that you would find valuable to incorporate into the website design. Could you share how that design was conceptualized and whether similar themes would be appropriate for the website?

I'm available anytime next week to discuss the website direction in more detail. Please let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can assist with.

I look forward to hearing your feedback and working together to capture your vision for the site.

Enjoy your weekend!

- Trent
