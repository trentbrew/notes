# Minimize Distractions (Maximizing Focus)

`Remove all unnecessary buttons, controls, formatting options` that don't contribute to the core writing process. Every option presented is one more thing for the brain to consider unnecessarily. **Keep only absolutely essential writing functions.**

# Natural Inputs (Maximizing Flow State)

`Voice dictation, predictive text, auto-completion` of repeated phrases help writing feel more like a **natural flow of thought**. The less physical effort exerted to input language, the more invisible the process becomes. Keyboard, mouse, complex commands should fade away.

# Contextual Awareness (Maximizing Efficiency) <!-- and relevance -->

If the app is aware of the `semantics, history and patterns` in one's writing context, it can improve suggestions and reduce cognitive load around things like corrections or format changes. Make informed recommendations **don't require explicit instructions.**

<!-- /*
You know that feeling when you know exactly what you wanna say and just wanna get it out, but you get hyperfixated on the details, grammar, discretion, etc? The app should be able to pick up on that and help you get your thoughts out without getting in the way. It will make your thoughts feel more fluid and natural. Less cognitive blockers.
*/ -->

# Modularity (Maximizing Flexibility)

Separate different modes or views like `[outline, prose, notes]`. Allow writers to hide/reveal only the UI components that match their immediate need. Don't show toolbars or features not related to the current intention. Let people write without being overloaded by options.

# Cross-platform Consistency (Maximizing Familiarity)

The functionality and user experience should remain fluid across devices. Whether on phone, tablet or computer, the app feels and functions the same. No need to relearn flows for different contexts.

# Conclusion

> In the end, writing tools aim to instill "flow state", that feeling of losing self-consciousness around the process and just channeling ideas creatively. The most invisible UI fades away so writers stay immersed in the emergent meaningful world crafted through words. What facilitates your writing flow? What obstructs it? Would love any other thoughts!

ADHD can be a superpower.

As I'm writing this, I realize how much I depend on inline prompting. It feels very natural. I wanna add that feature. I don't think any other writing app does that... ima check now.

This is what I mean. Branching off of the current thought. I'm a pin coushin. (get it?)

`What would be the most natural way to help me pin my thoughts and navigate my tree with grace? In a writing app sure, but also in everyday life.`

---

getting the thoughts out faster is the key. accurate autocomplete is the key. _the more accurate the autocomplete, the more invisible the writing process_ becomes.

`the system knows you welll enough for your writing to feel like thinking`. _it truly understands you (and your brand)._

It could semi-autonomously stay up to date on your brand and gather any information it needs to do its job even better.

How long are people stopping before they start writing again? /// Once they start writing again, what are they saying and how compared to the previous thing? /// are there patterns there? can we predict when they're gonna stop typing for more than 5 sec? can we optimize autocomplete to speed up debounce if the sys is confident theyll stop? ///

It makes you faster, more efficient, more accurate, more confident, more creative, more productive, more consistent, more reliable, more free

Spatial infinite canvas (longterm things)

Creative apps need to be spatial. They need to be trees. They need to mirror the way we think. They need to be able to represent the relationships between our thoughts, actions, environment, goals, values, beliefs, identity, purpose, telos, destiny, legacy, impact, potential, and future.

Suggestion tree

- we know there are multiple suggestions, but are they robust enough?

The reaosn I write in VSCODE is because of context awareness. Theres no mental overhead of the formatting, but the big thing is that the AI features not only know whats in this file but also the adjacent files and the entire project. It has context. It knows what I'm trying to get at. In this particular case not so much, but I'm curious if copilot++ is any better. Ima give it a shot. Lets go for it. It'll be science.

The user could have a profile in the app that allows for transparency about what the system knows - or the systems perception of the user. It can be manually tweaked. Yes. This is good. This is very good. It's like a brand profile but for the user. It's a user profile. Love. I need that.

There's gotta be a better way to provide context to the LLM than just sending a heap of text.. right?
