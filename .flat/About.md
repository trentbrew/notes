# About these notes

Hi 👋🏾 I'm [Trent Brew](https://trentbrew). I'm a full-stack developer, graphic designer, illustrator, and UX enthusiast. This isn't a blog, but a loosey goosey network of ideas and thoughts – I'm a bit of a perfectionist, so I'm trying to get over that by [[Learning Out Loud]] and publishing my [[Tree of Thoughts]] as it evolves. I hope this space can be a place for me to grow, learn, and share with like-minded folks.

# A bit about me

By day I work as a web/graphic designer at a Chicago-based agency called [Gumbo Media](https://gumbomedia.com). By night I run a smol dev shop called [[Turtle Labs]] where I build things I hope people find useful.

# What I'm working on

I'm currently working on a few projects:
1. Brevity: [[A Spatial Tool for Branching Thoughts]]
3. VectorSynth: [[Teaching LLMs How to Speak SVG]]
2. Hive: [[A New Way to Web]]
