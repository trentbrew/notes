# JOB DESCRIPTION

> Really, the "ideal" candidate only needs to know four things

- *HTML* (but not "Dreamweaver" HTML. "Hand-coded, semantic, well formated HTML")
- *CSS* (including all the new, vendor-prefixed, sort-of-works-in-some-browsers-but-never-in-IE stuff)
- *JavaScript* (the more the better, but less is OK.)
- *Photoshop* (you don't need to be a guru, but you should understand that Layer-based slices are a gift and should be treasured.)

> Other bits we'd love if you knew, but if you don't we'll just teach you them in your first week:

- *SASS* || *LESS*
- *Git*
- *Vue.js* && *Backbone.js*
- *JIRA*

> And there are some bits that, if you know, we'll be pleasantly surprised:

- Any programming language, with a preference for *Python*, *Java* or *Go*.
