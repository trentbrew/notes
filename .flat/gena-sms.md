**Gena:** Hey Trent! It's Gena. Help!! Need a new website for my new book

# **Date:** Wednesday, Aug 30 · 2:13 PM

**Trent:** HUGE congrats for the new book 🙌🏾💙
My apologies for the delayed response as I've been adjusting to a new job the past couple of months but will be wrapping up one of the bigger projects in mid September. If you'll still have me, I'd be more than happy to help with the new website starting on/after September 12th. I'm available that day anytime after 1pm EST, but let me know if another day would be best for a 60-90min discovery call.
Looking forward to catching up and learning more about your new book! Congrats again, and thank you so much for having me in mind for this project 🙇🏾

**Trent:** Hi Gena, I hope you're having a great weekend. I'm available anytime this coming week for a quick chat prior to our discovery session for your website, or if you'd like we can jump right into discovery and I'll send over a proposal from there. Let me know a time that works best for you. Looking forward to getting started!

**Gena:** Hi Trent, I've been traveling and once home a bit under the weather. Something to think about: I would like to make the book, my speaking engagement availability, lecture, and consulting a part of the website. I'm looking to do something in connection with my registered google domain names.
As you know, I have hidden gems consulting piece, and I've now secured genaclovettc-suitequotient.com as well.
I understand there is a way to create on google...I'm just now sure how.
Welcome your feedback. I have travel beginning Tuesday and I should be back on Friday.

**Trent:** Hey Gena, I hope you're feeling better and that your travels are going well 🌍
Thank you for the quick brief on the website features! I've gathering the following required features based on your message but let me know if I'm off-base anywhere:
1.) E-commerce functionality for users to purchase the book as well as links for 3rd party vendors (Amazon etc)
2.) A booking system similar to Calendly (for prospective HGC clients and users interested in booking speaking engagements etc) + a public calendar/schedule that displays upcoming talks/lectures/events and could allow users to purchase tickets to those events
3.) Video content of your talks/lectures + supplementary articles & blog posts
4.) A group of pages (or perhaps a totally separate site) dedicated to Hidden Gems Consulting with the same branding/logo/visuals as used previously + a similar Calendly booking system, overview of services, testimonials, case studies, contact, etc
If this feels accurate, I'd be happy to draft up a proposal based on this scope and send it over for your review sometime before next Thursday. From there we can hit the ground running as I want to be respectful of your time but also happy to sync over the phone or zoom if you'd like.
Looking forward to your thoughts!
