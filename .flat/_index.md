To start your website audit and needs assessment for CFHI's website, here's a comprehensive step-by-step guide tailored to your project goals:

### 1. Define Your Objectives

Before diving into the audit, clearly outline what you aim to achieve. Given your goals (boosting program engagement, promoting digital and physical channel diversity, virtual program promotion, enrollment tracking, website traffic, SEO improvement, and boosting digital presence), ensure your audit focuses on these areas.

### 2. Gather Your Tools

Equip yourself with a variety of tools for website analysis, including:

- **SEO Tools:** Google Analytics, SEMrush, or Ahrefs for tracking website traffic, keyword performance, and backlink analysis.

- **User Experience (UX) Tools:** Hotjar or Crazy Egg for heatmaps, session recordings, and user feedback.

- **Accessibility Tools:** WAVE or Axe for checking website accessibility compliance.

- **Performance Tools:** Google PageSpeed Insights or GTmetrix for loading speed and optimization insights.

### 3. Conduct Research

Your research will involve both qualitative and quantitative methods:

- **Quantitative:** Use your SEO and performance tools to gather data on current website traffic, keyword rankings, bounce rates, and page load times.

- **Qualitative:** Engage stakeholders through surveys or interviews to understand user experiences, needs, and perceptions of the website.

### 4. Website Content and Structure Review

- **Inventory Content:** List all pages and assess the relevance, quality, and engagement of the content towards your goals.

- **Navigation and User Flow:** Evaluate the ease of navigation and logical flow between pages. Use UX tools to see how users interact with the site.

### 5. SEO and Visibility Assessment

- **Keyword Analysis:** Identify which keywords the site ranks for and potential keywords to target.

- **Backlink Analysis:** Check the quantity and quality of backlinks.

- **On-page SEO:** Review meta tags, headers, image alt texts, and URLs for optimization.

### 6. Performance and Accessibility Evaluation

- **Page Speed:** Analyze loading times and identify bottlenecks.

- **Accessibility:** Ensure the site is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

### 7. User Experience (UX) and Engagement Analysis

- **User Feedback:** Collect and analyze user feedback for insights into their experience.

- **Heatmaps and Session Recordings:** Identify common patterns, points of interest, and potential frustrations.

### 8. Compile Findings and Observations

Organize your data and insights into the provided template sections. Highlight key issues and opportunities for improvement related to your objectives.

### 9. Formulate Questions

Based on your findings, list any questions that emerge. These could be about unclear user paths, reasons behind low engagement on certain pages, or how certain content can be better optimized for SEO.

### 10. Develop Recommendations

Offer actionable recommendations for each identified need, prioritizing them based on impact and feasibility. This might include suggestions for content updates, SEO improvements, UX redesigns, or technical enhancements.

### 11. Draft the Summary

Summarize your key findings and recommendations. This should provide a clear, concise overview of the audit's outcomes and next steps.

### 12. Review Documents

Now, let's review the meeting minutes, SOW, and contract you've provided to ensure all recommendations align with CFHI's expectations and contractual agreements.

I will start by opening and examining each document to extract relevant information that might guide or impact the audit process. Let's begin with the Master Meeting Minutes.

Based on the Master Meeting Minutes, here are the key points relevant to conducting your website needs assessment for CFHI:

- **Digital Presence and Strategic Direction:** CFHI is concerned about their digital presence not being as strategic as it could be to attract their target audience effectively. They aim to prioritize visibility of certain projects and programs that are crucial for engagement.

- **Pain Points:** Noted issues include certain keywords from previous blogs not showing up in searches, slow page loading times, and a need to highlight specific programs prominently.

- **User Engagement and Enrollment:** CFHI has noted that 80% of their students come through pre-existing relationships with universities, leaving a smaller percentage finding them online. There's a focus on increasing engagement and enrollment, especially for travel-based and virtual programs.

- **Audience Connection:** CFHI aims to better connect with their core audiences, including academic partners, students from individual enrollments, other professionals in global health, and parents seeking reassurance for their children's safety abroad.

- **Measurement and KPIs:** There's an interest in developing metrics for full engagement beyond clicks, focusing on application for programming and mapping increased enrollment in under-performing areas.

Your audit should focus on enhancing CFHI's digital presence to address these pain points, improve engagement and enrollment, effectively reach and communicate with their target audiences, and develop clear metrics to measure success. Consider these points when gathering information and formulating recommendations in your needs assessment template.

<!-- Next, I'll review the SOW (Statement of Work) document to ensure all recommendations align with CFHI's contractual expectations. -->

The Statement of Work (SOW) between Gumbo Media and CFHI outlines the project scope, deliverables, and timeline for improving CFHI's digital marketing and website optimization. The primary objectives include conducting a preliminary needs assessment, implementing targeted SEO and Google Ads strategies, and enhancing programmatic enrollment and site traffic. The project is set for a 13-month period, beginning in February 2024, with deliverables including a needs assessment report and ongoing digital marketing support. The SOW emphasizes collaboration, strategic partnership, and iterative feedback to ensure the effectiveness of digital marketing efforts and alignment with CFHI's goals.

<!-- Next, let's review the proposal document to identify any additional insights or details relevant to conducting your website needs assessment. -->

The proposal document outlines Gumbo Media's strategy for CFHI's digital marketing, including a preliminary needs assessment for website optimization and long-term SEO strategies. It details the process for conducting the needs assessment, including strategy sessions, asset collection, and delivery of a report to clarify website infrastructure, identify gaps, opportunities for optimization, and set preliminary KPIs. The project is structured over 13 months, focusing on boosting program enrollment and site traffic through targeted SEO and Google Ads, with a budget outlined for needs assessment and ongoing digital marketing support.

With the insights from the Master Meeting Minutes, SOW, and Digital Marketing Proposal, you're equipped with a clear understanding of CFHI's expectations, project scope, and deliverables. This foundation will guide your steps in auditing the site, filling out the template with relevant information, and ensuring your recommendations align with CFHI's strategic goals and contractual agreements.

For your next steps:
1. **Begin with the research phase**, using the tools mentioned earlier to gather quantitative and qualitative data.
2. **Evaluate the website** based on the findings and observations in the proposal and SOW, focusing on user engagement, SEO, performance, and accessibility.
3. **Formulate questions and recommendations** that address CFHI's goals to enhance digital presence, boost program engagement, and improve overall website performance and SEO.
4. **Draft your summary and detailed findings**, providing CFHI with actionable insights and a roadmap for website optimization and digital marketing enhancements.

This structured approach will help you conduct a thorough needs assessment, ensuring your audit and recommendations are well-informed, strategic, and aligned with CFHI's objectives.
