# The background

My name is Trent (he/him). I’m a 26 y/o tech-savvy Renaissance soul; Professionally a software engineer, I also delve into graphic design, UX, and dabble in art. By day I work as a web/graphic designer at a Chicago-based agency called Gumbo Media LLC. Gumbo Media curates content, experiences, and services to expand the narrative of Black life, and it’s fulfilling to work there as a black designer. By night I run a smol company called Turtle Labs LLC where I build things I hope people find useful.

# The situation (You = Trent)

You work at Gumbo Media as a web/graphic designer and have recently completed a project for a client, Dr. Ashley P.

Post-project, Dr. Ashley approached you about ongoing website maintenance and creative support on a freelance basis. You agreed and initiated a separate arrangement with her outside of Gumbo Media.

Gumbo Media hoped to retain Dr. Ashley as a client, and there were concerns about how your independent arrangement with her might affect this.
Developments:

You had a meeting with Matthew and the Ops team at Gumbo Media to discuss the situation. It was decided that Dr. Ashley's retainer should be routed through Gumbo Media.

You communicated this change to Dr. Ashley, who responded positively and agreed to the new arrangement.

You also have two other clients, Tenia Davis (Leadershipwise) and Gena Lovett (Hidden Gems Consulting), whom you are considering transitioning to Gumbo Media. Tenia is currently on an active retainer with you, and Gena recently inquired about website development for her book.
Recent Communications:

You received an email from Matthew Manning of Gumbo Media, outlining how to proceed with the transitions of Tenia and Gena to Gumbo Media.

For Tenia, he suggested informing her about folding most of your work with her into Gumbo Media, starting with a new contract in January.

For Gena, similar communication was advised, and once she agrees, you're to connect her with Gumbo Media.

Matthew also asked for any relevant communications you've had with both clients to help with scoping the projects in Gumbo's Sales portal.

Additionally, Matthew mentioned discussing what this means for your contract with Gumbo, ensuring that you are staffed on the projects you bring in.
Current Status:

You are preparing to communicate with Tenia and Gena about the transition to Gumbo Media.
You are also gathering relevant documentation and communications to provide to Gumbo Media for a successful transition.

This situation involves careful navigation of client relationships and internal coordination with Gumbo Media. Your role is pivotal in ensuring a smooth transition for the clients while aligning with Gumbo Media's processes and expectations.

# Gena and Tenia

I've been working with Tenia and Gena since 2020. Tenia is currently on an active retainer with me, and Gena recently inquired about website development for her book.
Tenia and Gena are good friends. Routing their retainers through Gumbo Media could be a good way to ensure that they both receive the same level of service and support.

## Email thread between Matthew (CEO of Gumbo Media) and Trent (Freelance Web Developer @ Gumbo Media):

Gena's Project (Hidden Gems Consulting):

Gena's project involves creating a professional and unique website for her consulting business, Hidden Gems Consulting (HGC). The website should reflect her brand and services, which include manufacturing operational excellence, professional executive coaching, and cultural consulting.

Gena's approach sets her apart from competitors as she not only provides analysis and a roadmap for improvement but also partners with clients through the implementation process and checks in post-implementation.

The website should include e-commerce functionality for users to purchase her book, a booking system for consultations and speaking engagements, video content of her talks/lectures, and supplementary articles & blog posts.

Tenia's Project (Leadershipwise):

Tenia Davis, Ph.D., runs Leadershipwise, a consultancy specializing in servant leadership. She needs a website redesign to promote her book and consulting services, including integrating training modules. She also requires video editing for online training courses, a social media strategy, and a marketing strategy for her book and services.

Transitioning to Gumbo Media:

Given the scope of these projects, transitioning them to Gumbo Media could provide additional resources and support to ensure their success. However, it's important to communicate this transition carefully to Tenia and Gena to maintain their trust and ensure they understand the benefits of this change.

Your Contract with Gumbo Media:

The impact of these transitions on your contract with Gumbo Media is something to discuss with Matthew. It's crucial to ensure that you are appropriately staffed on the projects you bring in and that the terms of your contract reflect the additional work and responsibility these projects entail.

Next Steps:

Before your meeting with Matthew, it might be helpful to prepare a list of key points to discuss, including the specifics of the new contracts with Tenia and Gena, the impact on your contract with Gumbo Media, and any potential challenges or concerns you foresee with these transitions.

# Summary

You're in a good spot. Dr. Ashley is on board, and you're preparing to communicate with Tenia and Gena about the transition to Gumbo Media. You're also gathering relevant documentation and communications to provide to Gumbo Media for a successful transition. My call with Matthew is scheduled for tomorrow, and I'm preparing a list of key points to discuss, including the specifics of the new contracts with Tenia and Gena, the impact on my contract with Gumbo Media, and any potential challenges or concerns I foresee with these transitions.

Subject: Discussing Exciting New Developments for the Leadershipwise Project

Hi Tenia,

I hope you're doing well.

I'm sorry for reaching out late in the evening, but I wanted to share some exciting news with you regarding our ongoing project. As we approach the renewal period of our contract into the holidays, I wanted to let you know that I've seeded a new working relationship, and will be folding (most of) my work moving forward through Gumbo Media, a boutique Black-owned agency.

I think it's important we discuss what this means for our work together, as this transition offers some fantastic opportunities for expanding the scope and quality of the Leadershipwise Project. I'd like to share more details with you, gather your thoughts, and ensure we're moving forward in a way that best serves the vision we've been building together.

Could we schedule a call for tomorrow morning to dive into this? Let me know a time that works for you, and I’ll make sure I’m available.

Looking forward to our conversation and continuing our journey together with these new developments.

Best regards,
