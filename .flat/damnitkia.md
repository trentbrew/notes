Hello Stripe Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

My name is Trenton Brew. I am a web developer based in Chicago, IL and I use Stripe to manage my client invoices, online stores, and SAAS subscriptions under Turtle Labs LLC.

I am reaching out because I was locked out of my Stripe account today at 2:50pm CT.

I suspect this happend because I logged into Stripe on my client's personal laptop yesterday (7/10/2024) to help setup a connected account to manage her online store. Based on the attached email (ID: em_awpkrmplil87wi9yfvn0r3dvnb8uuf), I see that the client has changed the email address on my Stripe account from `hello@trentbrew.com` to `kianijeedesign@gmail.com`, and the password has been changed as well.

The client has been unresponsive and I am not able to reset the password as I do not have access to the email address that the account is now linked to.

I hope the following information can help me recover access to my Stripe account:
