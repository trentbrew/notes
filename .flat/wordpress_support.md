Dear WordPress Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing on behalf of my client, [Client's Name], who is currently facing a challenging situation with her WordPress site due to domain and access issues.

# Background:

The original domain associated with my client's WordPress site has expired. Unfortunately, the domain was registered under the name of a previous developer, who has been unresponsive for an extended period. Despite our efforts to renew the domain or gain access through the registrar (GoDaddy), we were advised that only the original domain owner could make these changes. Given these circumstances, we have decided to acquire a new domain for my client's site.

# Current Issue:

We are prepared to update the site to use the new domain, but we are encountering a critical barrier: we are unable to access the WordPress admin dashboard due to the domain expiration and lack of access to the previous developer's account. This situation has effectively locked us out of the site, preventing us from making necessary updates, including pointing the site to the new domain.

# Request for Assistance:

Given the above, we urgently request your assistance with the following:

1.) Guiding us through the process of accessing the WordPress admin dashboard under these unique circumstances.
2.) Advising on the best steps to associate the new domain with my client's WordPress site, ensuring minimal disruption and downtime.

# Additional Information:

- Original Domain: leadership-wise.com
- Admin URL: leadership-wise.com/wp-admin
- New Domain: assessment.theleadershipwise.com

Please let me know if it would be helpful to provide any relevant account details that can verify my client's ownership of the site.

We understand the sensitivity and complexity of this request but are hopeful for a resolution that will allow us to restore full functionality to my client's website. We are committed to following all recommended steps and providing any additional information required to expedite this process.

Thank you in advance for your time and assistance. We look forward to your prompt response and are hopeful for a favorable resolution.

Warm regards,

Hello Trenton,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the domain and access issues your client is facing with their WordPress site. We understand the urgency of the situation and are here to help guide you through the process.

Accessing the WordPress Admin Dashboard with a New Domain
Since the original domain associated with the site has expired, and access to the previous developer's account is unavailable, we need to take a few steps to regain access to the WordPress admin dashboard.

Step 1: Add the New Domain
Log in to your WordPress.com account.
Go to your site's dashboard by visiting https://wordpress.com/home.
Navigate to Settings â†’ General.
Update the WordPress Address (URL) and Site Address (URL) fields with the new domain, assessment.theleadershipwise.com.
Save the changes.
Step 2: Accessing the Admin Dashboard
After updating the domain, you can access the admin dashboard by visiting `https://assessment.theleadershipwise.com/wp-admin`.
Log in with your WordPress.com credentials to gain access to the dashboard.
Associating the New Domain with the Site
To ensure a smooth transition and minimal downtime, follow these steps:

Update all internal links within the site to reflect the new domain.
Set up proper redirects from the old domain to the new domain to maintain SEO and user experience.
Verify ownership of the new domain through the domain registrar to avoid any future issues.
If you encounter any difficulties during this process or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We are here to support you and your client through this transition.

Warm regards,
