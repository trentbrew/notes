# The Feynman Technique

- The Feynman Technique is a unique learning method that prioritizes simplicity to create depth of understanding.
- Feynman's true genius was noted as his ability to convey complex ideas in simple, elegant ways.
- He observed that complexity and jargon are often used to mask a lack of deep understanding.
- The Feynman Technique is a learning framework that requires you to develop a deep understanding of a given topic.

*It involves four key steps:*

> 1.) Set the Stage

- What’s the topic you want to learn?
- Starting with a blank page, write the topic at the top and jot down everything you know about it.
- Read & research the topic.
- Add any new learnings or insights as you develop them.

> 2.) Explain It To Me Like I'm 5

- On a blank page, write down everything you know about your topic—but pretend you are explaining it to a child.
- Use simple language!

> 3.) Assess & Study

- How well were you able to explain the topic to a child? Where did you get frustrated? Where did you turn to jargon?
- These are the gaps in your understanding!
- Read and study more to fill them.

> 4.) Organize, Convey & Review

- Organize your elegant, simple language into a clear, compelling story or narrative.
- Remember: simple is beautiful.
