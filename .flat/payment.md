# From Trent to Matthew

Hey Matthew,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to follow up on the payroll status / earnings report for April. I understand that the internal work on the Gumbo site and Bronzeville Blues had not been prioritized this past month so I expect for that to be omitted, but I wanted to confirm whether the work for Speak MPLS will be included, and if there are any constraints on the client-side that would warrant an adjustment to the scope of work. I'd love to be in the loop and offer any support from both a creative and operational standpoint.

I'll be traveling to St. Louis next weekend and will be there until June 3rd, so I wanted to make sure I had everything squared away before then. I'm happy to jump on a call if that would be easier.

Thanks for everything, and I hope you have a great weekend.

Best,
Trent

Hi Trent –

My sincere apologies for the delay. There has been a long delay on our most prominent payroll contributor (Living Cities) which is helping us pay for everything, due to a renegotiation (increase) of that contract, which led to delays in the processing of invoices. I expected them this week, but got confirmation yesterday evening that we have substantive payments coming on Tuesday and Friday of next week, at which point we’ll be caught up monthly and we shouldn’t have to ensure any such delays again.

I will be issuing payment via payroll for Wednesday of next week. I will also be sending an earnings report over Monday to confirm all payments are on track.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks for the update, Matthew. I appreciate the transparency and the heads up. I'll keep an eye out for the earnings report on Monday and will let you know if I have any questions.

Thanks again, and have a great weekend 🙏🏾
