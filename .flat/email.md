# Context

Khayriyyah (Philanthropy Advisor) is a friend of my older sister. My older sister's wedding was a few weeks ago, and Khariyyah and I connected at the wedding. She saw some designs I did for my sister's bridal shower and asked if I was interested in doing some work for Geneva Global, as they need a lot of help with graphic design work. I told her I was interested in hearing more. She reached out today about the opportunity, so I'm writing a response.

She sent this messsage over text in addition to the email:

"Hi Trenton! It’s Khayriyyah, Candice’s friend! I just sent you an email about the contractor bench at my job.

No pressure at all but if you’re interested, I’d love to chat further about having you join and happy to answer any questions you have!"

I responded with the following message:

"Hey Khayriyyah! I received your email and am definitely interested. I’m taking a moment now to compile some examples of my work and the other materials which I will be sending out shortly. Thank you again for the opportunity 🙏🏾"

Here is her original email:

[SUBJECT: Geneva Global Contractor Bench]

Hi Trenton,

I hope you are well! I wanted to reach out and follow up on our conversation about the contractor bench we have here at Geneva Global, a philanthropic advisory firm. Your skills with graphic design could be an asset to our bench as we spend quite a bit of time developing presentations for clients and could always use new perspectives to help us think about new ways to make information engaging. Here is a bit more information about this opportunity and confirm your interest in pursuing the contracting hiring process further.

### Flow of Work

Before getting into the types of work that happen on our contractor bench, I’d like to highlight the flow of work and what to expect there. We usually pull in our contractors when we need more support on different projects or at times of surge periods with our clients. This means we cannot guarantee a steady stream of work (i.e. we can't guarantee something like 10 hours of work each week or month), as it depends on the flow of our client needs and our internal team capacity. Contracting with our team works best for folks that are available on short notice and not dependent on a guaranteed number of hours each month, which we understand can be a unique circumstance. Before moving forward in the hiring process, we like to make this as clear as possible. Additionally, our starting rate for contractors is $80/h. I am happy to answer any further questions you might have after reading through this information.

### What does the Donor Advising Team at Geneva Global usually need support with?

- Desk Research
- Writing
  - Report-style
  - Executive-style
  - Briefs
- Copyediting
- Data Analysis
- Excel Wizardry
- Slide Deck/PowerPoint Design
- Visual Design for reports or other documents
- Graphic Design

### Example Contracting Asks

- Copyedit a brief that includes bios for 10-15 Africa focused philanthropists.
- Draft a design for a presentation deck that highlights key learnings and prompts questions and conversation on a maternal newborn health initiative.
- Conduct desk research on corporate secondment models to share with an internal working group.

### What’s Next?

If you’re interested in moving forward with the hiring process for our contracting bench, please respond to this email with:
- A copy of your CV
- A confirmation of what skills you would like to offer
- At least two examples of previous work that highlights those skills

Upon receipt of your materials, our team will review internally and reach out to schedule a time for a 30-minute interview with two team members. Our team will discuss fit internally and reach out with a decision to join the bench.

That was a lot of information, but I am happy to answer any questions you might have. Let me know if you think this opportunity aligns with your work and interest and I look forward to continuing the conversation from there.

Best,
Khayriyyah
