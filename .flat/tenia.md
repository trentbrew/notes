Hey Tenia, I hope all is well. You're correct, this is the home stretch and the remaining tasks for the webflow site can be found this Notion board: https://trentbrew.notion.site/LW-Sprint-3-3c8204ce59184761b0043735c7ea3ee0

I'm aiming to streamline the process of requests/feedback and I think a shared Notion will be a great way to do that. You can add comments in the upper right with any questions or requests and I'll be able to respond directly in the Notion and create tasks as needed. This final sprint closes on Mon Jan 1st, and I'll be available to sync anytime during that week to get you onboarded as an admin and get the new domain plugged in for the official launch.

Regarding the 2nd phase, I've been researching options for the online courses and community features and was wondering if you've heard of https://www.skool.com ? It seems like it could be a really great fit especially as a way to foster community around servant leadership. It seems very similar to the original concept for the LW app but I'd love to hear your thoughts during our sync.

Let me know a time that works best for you and I'll get us scheduled asap.

Happy Holidays to you and yours üôèüèæ

Hey Tenia, I hope you're well. I wanted to reach out and let you know that your domain is still pending but it is available for backorder from it's registrar dynandot.com: https://www.dynadot.com/market/backorder/leadership-wise.com

Backordering means placing a reservation on a domain name that is currently in the process of being deleted after its previous registration expired. This service allows you to automatically acquire the domain the moment it is released/available.

More information on the backorder process can be found here: https://www.dynadot.com/community/help/question/place-a-backorder

I cannot confirm when exactly the domain will be released, but this will ensure that you will own it as soon as it is available. I wish there was more I could do, but this is the best option I could find. Let me know if you have any questions or need help with the process.
