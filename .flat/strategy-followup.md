Hey @Sandiel and @Trent Brew! How are y'all feeling about the strategy meeting from this week? I personally thought we got a lot of helpful information. I'm sending a long a few things here. PLEASE READ till the end and respond, as I'm hoping to map out next steps for your moodboarding and concepting deliverables.

HERE are all the brand references Elaine spoke about, in our Drive. The "Elaine Wackerly Home" doc features the mood boards HERE are the meeting minutes from the strategy call, also in OneNote, where I chronicle them in live time.

Below are the brand inspos she named (also in the files above):
- Heidi Caillier
- Beata Heuman
- Jessica Helgerson

Our next steps are to:
1. We're supposed to create a Mood Board that aggregates all inspo to anchor our concepting phase. But given she already has 3 mood boards, I'm going to ask if it's alright to bypass this process and just use her mood boards as guidance for concepting.
2. Syncing internally to generate some higher-level concepts for logo and brand. (Please let me know what availability you have next week!)
3. Create our logo and brand concepts and populate a shared deck (still to come).

What are your thoughts on the following timeline for these to-dos?:
- Wed 4/11 (EOD): V1 concepts due
- Wed 4/24 (EOD): V2 concepts due
- Only applicable to the selected designer
- We'd sort out any subsequent dates as we near V2.

Let me know if you have any questions or need any support here. I'll await your responses. Thanks!

UPDATE: I can confirm that a mood board will not be necessary. So we can bypass that step and gi directly into concepting.

Hey @Matthew, thanks for sending these over! I'm feeling good about the strategy session. I think we got a lot of good information and I'm excited to get started on the concepting phase. I'm available anytime in the afternoon next week to sync internally.
