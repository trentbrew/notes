According to [CB Insights](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/), 70% of startups fail within the first 20 months.

   - **_Growth:_** The startup market is growing rapidly. According to [CB Insights](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/), the number of startups has increased by 50% since 2011. The startup market is expected to continue growing at a rate of 10% per year over the next decade. However, only a small fraction of the total $215.9 billion in U.S. venture capital allocated in Q4 2022 was allocated to traditionally under-represented founders. According to [Tech Crunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/06/black-founders-still-raised-just-1-of-all-vc-funds-in-2022/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmluZy5jb20v&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAClkIVcpxodpQHebLUfqo0OwzvI2VcqYnvf6ymQi1SdeB8WTV1JJAuinw7rV7TzmFmvaSy_Blx2luyQBdHt4sxL7IUMVdAzdwRVYE1vaQwdub5LiKDVArXQkUAE_0ysBzFubzaTltde7tEJu0Gk5NcYM2War68B9PSXFJd5B9UDx) and [BOSTINNO](https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/inno/stories/news/2022/07/22/black-latinx-startups-funding-h12022.html), only 0.79% of the total VC funding from Q4 2022 went to black founders, and in Massachusetts alone only 1% of funding was raised by Latinx founders.
