Hi Trent ‚Äì

 

Thanks for the message. As Sierra noted, some members from the Ops team‚ÄîQuianna (Culture), Etiti (Ops), and myself‚Äîwill be in touch. We‚Äôre syncing next week (Tuesday) on a couple of Gumbo items, and will follow-up shortly thereafter.

 

Let me know if you have any questions in the meantime! Thanks.

Hi Trent, 

 

Thank you for following up with this thoughtful response. 

 

As far as the additional work with Dr. Ashley, I do think you should follow up with the Operations team to discuss this further. We may actually have some of this framework in place, but Matthew or Etiti would be able to confirm. 

 

Either way, I'm glad this has been such a positive learning opportunity for you. I do understand the crippling impact of anxiety and appreciate your willingness to be vulnerable as we all reflect on the lessons learned from this experience. 

 

Have a great week!

Hey Sierra,

 

I‚Äôve spent some time reflecting on your email and I want to sincerely apologize for overstepping the project's scope and our established processes at Gumbo. I understand the importance of adhering to protocols, and I regret any confusion my actions may have caused. My aim is always to achieve the best possible outcomes for our projects and Gumbo's relationship with clients. I now see that in my eagerness, I inadvertently crossed boundaries, offering me a valuable learning moment. I am committed to ensuring all communication and project scopes are properly routed through the designated channels moving forward.

 

Regarding the direct work request from Dr. Ashley, I want to be transparent. The request involved a substantial website migration to a self-hosted platform to grant her more control over her content and its preservation. Realizing this was a complex and delicate situation, and not wanting to overstep my role, I find it necessary to discuss how we might best serve Dr. Ashley's long-term needs, as well as those of other clients with similar requirements. I'm eager to help establish frameworks or processes for managing such full-stack development work. The idea of Gumbo expanding to offer these services is exciting, especially considering the potential benefits for diverse small businesses and startups. I'd love to discuss this further with the team if possible.

 

I'm blessed to be able to contribute to Gumbo's mission and it's a mission I aim to uphold in my own work. I've learned so much from the team in my short time here and I've never felt more supported in my personal & creative development ~ The thought of negatively impacting the team or our clients feels to me like negatively impacting my family and I'm in a constant state of worry that I might do so by saying the wrong thing, making the wrong move, doing too much or too little. It's a fragile, paralyzing state of mind that I'm working to overcome, and I'm grateful that I can work on it in a safe space like Gumbo.

 

I'm sorry for the long email, but I wanted to be thorough. Thanks for your guidance and support, and I hope everyone has a great weekend.

 

Best,

Trent

Hey Trent, 

 

I appreciate your prompt response to Dr. Ashley; however, I do want to acknowledge that Dr. Ashley is requesting items that she isn't actually scoped to receive. Before sending over the closing email, I did a quick contract review, and I intentionally did not provide a wordmark + logo because those branding assets have an additional costs. 

 

Typically, if this kind of request comes in from a client, I would confirm next steps with the Operations and Sales team before moving forward.  

 

I also want to acknowledge that all communication should go through the PM, in order to avoid any confusion. Please refrain from any additional communication with Dr. Ashley in regard to this specific scope. If there is a need, I will follow up via Slack. 

 

I recognize this tone is a bit direct; however, I want to make sure we are all aligned. At Gumbo, there are specific processes in place for the benefit of the full team and I want to make sure those to honored correctly. 

 

Thanks again for your hard work.

 

Sierra Council

Good morning Dr. Ashley,

 

The color variations for the wordmark and logomark have been added to the Google Drive and can be found here: logo - Google Drive. The mobile landing image has also been updated as well üëçüèæ

Regarding the Squarespace error, I just sent over an ownership transfer confirmation which I believe will resolve the issue. I've set up <smith-purviance.1@osu.edu> as the primary contact on the site for now.

Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything at all I can help with

 

Best,

Trent

Hi Sierra, 

 

Thanks for sharing this update.  I really do appreciate all the work with you & the Gumbo team, and I look forward to working together in the future again. I do have a few follow-up questions... 

 

Is it possible to have the various assets/images of the wordmark and logomark with all the color variations shared in the google drive? I just need these to update all social media, etc. accounts with this new branding. 
Is there any update on the custom domain email? I realize the contact page submissions are still coming to my personal email. So, I tried again to register for the contact@therollingarchives.org email via square space again. If it is approved, I'll need assistance with linking it all. 
I emailed Trent separately but on the mobile version of the site the home page still shows the older version of the collage, and I would need that updated. I'm looking through the guide but didn't see how to edit the mobile version of the site. Is this a quick fix that can happen until I learn to navigate the site editor? 
Also, I heard back from Sarah, and she is taking care of remaining invoices; she was waiting approval from the financial team-- I hope this is rectified soon but please keep me updated as well. 

 

Sincerely, 

 

Ashley
