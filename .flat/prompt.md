I'm drawn to the software developer role at PKP for its alignment with both my professional experience and personal values. With a rich background in web development, notably at Gumbo Media and 64 Robots, I have honed my skills in PHP, SQL, and front-end technologies, making me well-suited for developing PKP's Open Journal Systems, Open Monograph Press, and Open Preprint Systems. My experience at Lofty and as a Web Developer Intern at HBR Consulting, where I worked on a variety of software applications and led the development of an internal tool, demonstrates my ability to contribute to complex projects and collaborate effectively within a team. Additionally, my role as a mentor at We All Code reflects my enthusiasm for community engagement and open source projects, aligning with PKPâ€™s mission. My portfolio of working across different technologies, alongside my passion for open source software and scholarly communication, positions me as a valuable asset to your team.
