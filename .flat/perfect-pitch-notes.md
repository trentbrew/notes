# Packaging up our idea so that we can share it with others

The goal: _Be clear_

**Targets**

- Problem
- Solution
- Insight

**Evaluation**

- "Do I understand it?"
- "Am I excited by it?"
- "Do I like the team?"

**Two questions**

- "Describe your company in 50 characters or less"
- "What is your company going to make?"

**Quotes**

- "A clear idea is a foundation for growth"
- "Marketing and advertising are a tax companies pay because they did not make something remarkable"

**How to make things easy to understand**

- Make it _Legible_
- Make it _Simple_
- Make it _Obvious_

> Designing something that democratizes the idea

**Things to avoid**

- Ambiguity
- Complexity
- Mystery
- Ignorable lanugage

**Things to do**

- Conversational (mom gets it)
- No preamble (get right to it, no winding paths)
- No jargon
- Reproducible (can be repeated by others)

**Nouns**

- What are you making?
- What is the problem?
- Who is the customer?

**Examples**

- Airbnb: "Airbnb is the first online marketplace that lets travelers book rooms with locals, instead of hotels."
- Dropbox: "Dropbox synchronizes files across your/your team's computers."

**How to be efficient**
