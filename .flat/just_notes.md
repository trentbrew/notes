- Intelligence is the ability to learn from experience, adapt to new situations, understand complex concepts, and use knowledge to manipulate one’s environment. It's more than just processing data; it's about making sense of that data, finding connections, drawing conclusions, solving problems, and creating new ideas.

This artwork depicts a dark fantasy character, clad in a brown leather armor with metal studs, wearing a menacing helmet with spikes. The character wields a long, slender sword with a flanged mace head near the hilt, suggesting a combination of elegance and brutality in their design. The background is minimal, a muted brown tone that casts the figure in a somber or possibly ominous light. He is known as the Sentinel of the Dusk Realms. He is not a knight. He does not have armor.

- The Quantum Mind Hypothesis suggests that consciousness and mental processes are based on quantum mechanics, rather than being explained by classical Newtonian physics. It proposes that our brains function at a microscopic level in ways that are only understood through the principles of quantum physics, such as superposition, entanglement, and coherence. Proponents of this theory argue that these quantum phenomena could account for some of the most mysterious aspects of human cognition, like free will and the nature of self-awareness.

- lets really lean into the @perfect_pitch.md thing. This deck is to introduce Rebecca to the Docket.tv concept not only as the first user/tester but also as a client and a potential partner on the Docket project. I have a ton of @questions.md for her related to their operational challenges and I hope to gain the insights I need to go full speed ahead. I've already built an MVP which I'll share with Mathew today before our call with Rebecca tomorrow to get his thoughts. We're all still kinda wrapping our head around this thing. I understand what it is I'm building and the end-goal hasn't changed much at all, but I want to be able to get Rebecca and Matthew as excited about Docket.tv as I am in as few words and with as few mysteries as possible.

- A Webflow plugin for Docket
- i notice some of these are live streaming infrastructure rather than a CMS / frontend that runs ontop of existing infrastructure, like what Docket is designed for. Tell me, can you think of any products out there that empower niche/independent broadcasters who run their own equipment and infrastructure to manage their entire operation in one place, and can seamlessly integrate with their stack including cablecast, similar software, 3rd party tools for tracking people, equipment, events, shows, producers, viewers, scheduling, closed captioning, content uploads, interactive & highly visual user-facing tvguide, integration with custom data, has a webflow plugin for serving and rendering tvguides, shows, and producer profiles, and costs less than  per month
- No, I can't think of any single product that meets all those specific requirements. Most solutions either focus on live streaming infrastructure (like Wowza) or content management (like Zype), but not both, and they often exceed the /month budget. Docket.tv's unique combination of features and integrations seems to fill a niche that isn't fully addressed by existing products.
- Given the extensive features and integrations, a reasonable subscription fee would likely be around - per month.

- Hey, I wanted to touch base about last night – by the time I got to yall I could hear everybody having a good time and felt anxious about barging in 3hrs late & vandilizing the vibe. If I really wanted to I could've blew up yalls phones but felt paranoid about it for some reason & rushed back home. I feel like this social anxiety thing is getting out of hand and it's leading to a lot of self-sabotage & overall busllshit behavior. Your party is literally the reason I came back to Chicago and I feel sick about getting all the way there only to psyche out and go home. I understand if you're over it at this point. I just wanted you to know what actually went down and what be going through my head. I'm just really happy to see everybody had a good time<3 Here for you always – I'll be ironing out the shop front-end this week and will be available Tue & Fri to sync if you're free.

The form itself is comprised of multiple custom components – @DynamicForm.vue generates several @Field.vue components as children based on a the schema passed in as a prop. Each section of the form has exactly one <DynamicForm />, which willl generate many <InputField />. <InputField /> is a catchall input that can be any type (ie. select, textarea, email, tel, date, number, select, etc).

Use your intuition the resources provided to decide the best way to structure the schemas for each section so that the Input fields are generated correctly and have the correct types and render the correct options.

@schema.md is your blueprint for the form. It is comprised of sections, each section has a title and description, and a list of fields and their respective types.

The options for the selector input types can be found here: @options.js 

The current form uses a bespoke validator which will come in handy. The validator can be found here: @form.js 

I understand that this is a lot to digest, but I hope it will be helpful.

You got this! Let me know if there's anything else I can provide for you.
- cuz I'm tired of being harvested
- people take
- using an iPhone after 13yrs of android makes me realize the importance of building tools that enable users to solve their own problems. I want a fishing net, not a fish sandwich.
- this drawing is a visual overload in the best way. it's like you threw your mind onto the page without holding anything back. the chaotic patterns and shapes give it a sense of spontaneity, like you were just letting your hand go wherever it wanted without overthinking. there's a lot of movement in the lines, which makes it feel alive, like the whole thing is in motion. the little figures and symbols scattered throughout add a playful, almost whimsical touch, balancing out the more abstract elements. 

it feels like a mix of stream of consciousness and intricate doodling, something you might do when you're lost in thought. there's a lot of energy in it, but it's not chaotic in a random way—it seems intentional, like there's some underlying logic or pattern that only you fully understand. 

overall, it’s engaging and has a lot of personality. it’s the kind of thing that keeps your eyes moving, always finding something new to focus on. it reflects someone who’s not afraid to explore complexity and messiness, and who finds meaning in details that might seem insignificant at first glance. 

in short, it’s the kind of art that feels like a conversation with the artist—one where you’re never quite sure what’s going to come up next, but you’re curious enough to stick around and find out.
- The reason I showed you this is because this is how I most effectively communicate. Words tend to feel constricting or suffocating when I try to express the kinds of things I can when I'm drawing. Writing, reading, speaking, and communicating tends to feel suffocating and very uncomfortable to me, like a waterfall trying to run through a fossit.

Idk if this makes sense and I hessitate to talk about this often cuz people have told me that this makes me a narcisist, like I have this overinflated idea of the value of what goes on in my head or something... anyway its how ive felt my whole life and I've been told its an autism thing and definitely negatively impacts my ability to connect w people. It makes me feel like a person that needs fixing, like I'm not equipt to do everyday things like talk to people or do meetings at work or send emails... I spend so many hours writing emails. It is exhausting and feels very unnatural and I get a visceral reaction about witnessing the lose lose situation that is the effect I have on the people around me.

It is exhausting and feels very unnatural and I get a visceral reaction about witnessing the lose lose situation that is the effect I have on the people around me.

Visuals & experiences are the only ways I know how to connect with people. I love seeing people in person, but I feel like a bad friend/brother/son/person/employee when I struggle to communicate.

On the other hand, programming, drawing, painting, design, music, etc feels natural and honest and safe and calm. I feel trust in myself and everyone and the universe & all that jazz.

I didn't mean for this to become a therapy session, I just wanted to let you know in the only way I know how why I'm building this silly writing tool. I desperately need it, and it doesn't exist. I think if I can become as comfortable with writing as I am with programming, by turning writing into programming, maybe that will be the catalyst for maintaining and creating the kinds of connections that I need to not wanna disappear from the face of the earth & shit. u know?

I imagine there must be a better way to go about it tho. I'm looking into MDX and Nuxt Content as possible starting points for me to feel more at home with expressing myself through a model of prose that feels structured & squishy & surgical.
- sucker shit
- some people are addicted to solving problems. others are addicted to creating problems. everyone is addicted to problems.
- people really are deserate for that double tap. i understand why, but I also feel like its a shame that artists are so hyperfocused on the outcome of their work rather than the process. especially when the outcome is something that is free, takes no time, no thought, and no effort.

The imbalance between the feeling of recieving a like and giving a like is super interesting to me. This whole thread feels like a fish net and it makes me sad.

I wonder if there's a viable alternative model for allowing artists to engage with their audiences in a way that is more intimate, predictable, measureable, and sustainable. 

If instagram was a physical place I would imagine it as a large loud stuffy overcrowded art gallery where every 3 seconds somenoe is trying to sell you something or waving you down to get your attention, all while you're just trying to see the art. you can't see over peoples' shoulders and you can't hear over the chatter. Everyone is together in this space and yet they are all alone.

I imagine a space that is cozy and intimiate. It should feel less like a drug and more like a hug.
- weird
- thoughtfulness & intentionality
- I wanted to touch on the article you mentioned and express that even after a couple of years I'm still confronted with similar challenges and I feel that it's a big part of what drove me to pursue freelance work, and especially what drove me to pursue Gumbo. I think personal barriers become harder to penetrate once enough time is spent in spaces where you can't fully show up, and I'm still learning to break down those personal & creative barriers so I'm grateful for the opportunity to grow with the brand & work with you both, and potentially serve Gumbo across disciplines in the future.

- I have a nuxt 3 app hosted on vercel, on a domain I purchased through namecheap. the app is called docket. It is an app similar to twitch. I want publically accessible streams to be located at  and I want the admin CMS for broadcasters managing content to be located at a subdomain .

Can you walk me through step by step how to setup dynamic subdomains using Namecheap, Vercel, and Nuxt 3?

First I want you to provide an overview of what the whole process will look like, then I want to start at step 1 together. I want you to break each step into actionable tasks, and we will do one at a time. Please don't move on to the next step until we have confirmed that the current step is completed and valid.

I've never done this before, so I want you to checkin with me often to make sure I understand what and doing and why. Use analogies and metaphors as needed.

Also, don't be too verbose. I wanna tiptoe through this and make sure I have room to ask questions.

Hows that sound?
