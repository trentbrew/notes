# Modular UIs

- toggle different views of your information (outline, map, prose, etc)

# Context awareness

- context-awareness is the ability of a system or system component to gather information about its environment at any given time and adapt behaviors accordingly.

- The system can be aware of the user's context, the context of the content, and the context of the environment. The system knows what the user is doing (within the app), what they're trying to do, and what they're going to do next. The system can pickup on subtle cues from the user's behavior and adapt accordingly.

# Living UI

- The UI is the body & limbs of the system. The UI can gesture, point, and move to indicate what the system is doing and what it's going to do next. The UI can also be used to gather information from the user and the environment. This allows the system to communicate with the user in a more natural non-verbal/hybrid way.

- The colors and shapes of the UI can change to indicate the system's state (error, success, warning, etc). The UI can also be used to indicate the state of the user and the environment (ie. If the time of day is night, the UI can slightly dim, etc).
