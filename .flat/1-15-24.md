# Market Analysis

---

### Target Market

1. **_Startups:_** Gumbo Media will build custom web, mobile, and desktop applications for early stage start-ups. Startups often have unique technological requirements and a need for innovative software solutions to support their growth and establish a competitive advantage.

- The startup market in 2023 experienced a significant decline in venture funding compared to the previous years. Global startup investment reached $285 billion in 2023, a 38% decrease from the $462 billion invested in 2022. This downturn was observed across all funding stages, with early-stage funding experiencing a reduction of more than 40% year over year. However, it's important to note that despite these cutbacks, the overall funding in 2023 was still less than 20% lower compared to the pre-pandemic years of 2018 to 2020. Additionally, the U.S. venture capital funding amounted to $63 billion in 2023, holding 49% of the total global venture capital funding of $683 billion. In contrast to these trends, AI was one of the few sectors that saw an increase in investment, with global funding to AI startups reaching nearly $50 billion in 2023, up 9% from 2022【12†source】【14†source】.
- In light of these statistics, Gumbo Media's focus on providing affordable development and design services, strategic guidance, and technical expertise to startups becomes even more crucial. As the startup market continues to evolve, Gumbo Media's efforts can play a significant role in supporting startups, particularly those with underrepresented founders. Additionally, considering Black Ambition Prize ([blackambitionprize.com](http://blackambitionprize.com/)) as a potential funding resource can be beneficial, as it offers opportunities and support to Black and Latinx entrepreneurs.

This number accounts for over 99% of all businesses in the country and employs 48.75% of the workforce. 10% of which are black-owned businesses according to [BusinessDIT](https://www.businessdit.com/black-owned-businesses-statistics/).
   - **_Growth:_** Small businesses are ripe for innovation, as they are often more agile and flexible than larger companies, which can make it easier for them to adapt to new technologies and trends. Additionally, small businesses often have less bureaucracy and fewer layers of management, which can make it easier for them to implement new ideas quickly.

# Financial Projections

---

### Operating Expenses

- **_Software Services & Tools:_**
  - **_Figma_** (Design): `$12 per seat/month | 3 seats | Total: $36/month` // We could share a single account
  - ~~**_Adobe Creative Cloud_** (Design): `$?/month`~~ // Removed in favor of Figma?
  - **_GitHub_** (Dev): `$3.67 per user/month | 3 users | Total: $11/month`
  - **_Vercel_** (Hosting): `$20 per user/month | 3 users | Total: $60/month` // We could share a single account
- **_Metered Costs:_**
  - **_Gemini_** (Generative AI): `$0/month` // Gemini is currently in beta and is free to use
  - **_OpenAI_** (Generative AI): `$???/month` // [OpenAI is priced per API call](https://openai.com/pricing). We will use Gemini for now, but we may need to switch to OpenAI in the future if Gemini is no longer free. Monthly costs will depend on the number of API calls we make, and could be significant. Monetization strategies for AI integration could include charging clients a fixed monthly fee for using AI features.
  - **_Amazon Web Services_** (Storage): $???/month // [AWS S3 pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/). S3 will only become necessary once we start storing large amounts of data. We could also use PocketBase for storage until then, which is free up to 1GB. Monthly costs will depend on the amount of data we store and will likely be negligible.
  - **_Stripe_** (eCommerce): `$0/month` // Stripe is free to use, but a 2.9% + $0.30 fee is charged for each transaction. We could pass this fee on to the client or include it in our pricing.
  - **_PocketHost_** (Development): `$0/month` // PocketHost offers a free forever tier for its service, which includes unlimited (fair use) CPU, bandwidth, and storage.
    - **_Streamable_** (Storage): `$8.99/month` // Streamable is great for hosting, streaming, and embedding videos that are too large for PocketBase. It is free to use, but the free plan only allows for 250MB of storage. The $8.99/month plan allows for 500GB of storage which should be more than enough for our needs.
- **_Other:_**
  - **_Notion_** (Project Management): `$0 per user/month` // Personal Notion accounts are free and we can leverage the free tier for now. We may need to upgrade to a paid plan in the future if we need more features.
  - **_Zapier_** (Automation): `$19/month` // Zapier is free for two-step zaps, but we will likely need to upgrade to a paid plan in the future if we need more features. Starter plan is $19/month and allows for multi-step zaps which will be necessary for the AI automation service as well as internal workflows.
