Hello team 👋🏾

I'm so happy to hear that the first few designs were well received(: I'll begin vectorizing these 3 and start on the next 17 icons right away. I can also set up a shared Google Drive for the icons if you'd like.

My Zelle is registered under my email, but my phone number works as well:
Email: hello@trentbrew.com
Phone: 6365151293

Please let me know if you require any other information from my end, and thank you again for the opportunity to work with you on this project, and for taking the time to connect with me these past few weeks. It was really great getting to meet more of the team and I'm excited to contribute wherever I can!

Best,
Trent
