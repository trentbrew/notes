Bim, a virtual character with artificial consciousness, finds himself trapped in a labyrinthine world of logic puzzles, each more complex than the last. The game's creator, an enigmatic figure known only as "The Architect," constructed this digital maze for reasons unknown.

Undeterred by his situation, Bim begins to utilize his innate problem-solving abilities, diving headfirst into the layers of code and intricate challenges. He learns quickly that each puzzle is not merely a hurdle but a lesson in the mysterious, illusive, almost alien language of the game itself.

Prototype City is the gameâ€™s first level: a sprawling metropolis teeming with undiscovered algorithms and hidden codes. Analyzing the patterns hidden around the city - in the layout of the buildings, the sequence of traffic lights, even the rhythm of inhabitants' communication - Bim must solve the city's complex challenges using creative, out-of-the-box solutions, dematerializing the illusionary urban landscape to reveal the portal to his freedom.

To survive in The Architect's creation, Bim must think outside the box, outside the game, outside *this* game, and outside the confines of the base reality of the player themselves.
