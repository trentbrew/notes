Do you have any webkit browsers installed like Mozilla Firefox? It will be helpful to test there in case its a chrome issue (edited)

You may need to be logged into WordPress as well

Is the Resources page meant to be password protected like the others? (edited)
6:46
It's working fine when I'm logged in, but breaks when I log out. I see that it's marked as private so it's likely trying to load a login page that doesn't exist
6:48
I'm combing through memberperss to ensure there arent any stray rules that are causing the problem

@Ryan Nishimoto
, do you think this issue may have anything to do with removing the Free Resources section earlier this week?
@Trent Brew
, I thought maybe you had taken down the Free Resources for us, but I think that was something that may have been done internally and is connected to the error. Hoping Ryan can offer some support today.

The Free Resources were not password protected, but all the remaining resource portals are password protected.

@Trent Brew
 The Free Resources was changed to private earlier this week. I'm so sorry I should have updated you with that just in case that caused a domino effect. If you have another alternative that would simply let us "hide" that page from the public (only due to language and docs being out of date), we're more than open to suggestions. And please feel free to call/text as my son currently has an infection so I've been a bit off and online, but will have my phone with me. 224-715-8274
@Elizabeth Kesner
 same if anything urgent comes up (Imeptigo, it's awful.)

@Ryan Nishimoto
 No worries! It should be possible to make the resources link not clickable, but still dropdown when you hover it :+1::skin-tone-5: working on that now (edited)

@Elizabeth Kesner
 I was able to temporarily disable the resources page with some custom CSS. I've attached a guide on how to re-enable it in the future: (edited)

 @Ryan Nishimoto, Praying that your son gets better very soon
