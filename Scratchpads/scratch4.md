# Overview

---

**The Founding Phrases** exhibition at the Library of Congress' Treasures Gallery requires **exhibit design** services.

# Scope of Work

---

- **Synopsis**

    The primary task is designing the "Founding Phrases" exhibition, which focuses on the legacy of the Declaration of Independence, marking the semi-quincentennial. The contractor is designing the **entire experience** of the exhibit, from visual aesthetics to the physical layout and fabrication instructions. This will require significant expertise in **3D design, CAD work**, and **exhibit planning.**

- **Project Scope**
    1. **Designing the Entire Exhibit Layout**:
        - The contractor will be responsible for the **conceptual design, development, and final design** of the exhibition. This includes the layout of exhibit elements, casework, and the arrangement of approximately 100 artifacts, with all aspects being iteratively refined in collaboration with the Library of Congress team.
    2. **Creating Exhibit Graphics and Physical Components**:
        - The design work includes **graphic design, environmental graphics**, and creative elements to enhance the exhibit, such as typography, color palettes, and promotional materials. It also involves working on the **physical structures**, such as exhibit cases, partitions, and other design elements.
    3. **Technical Specifications for Fabrication**:
        - Beyond the visual and conceptual design, you will need to provide detailed **technical drawings and specifications** for the fabrication of exhibit elements. This includes **frame, mat, and graphic schedules** as well as material specifications and safety testing.
- **Timeline**

    The project spans from December 2024 to April 2026, including two rotations of 100 objects each. The project is comprised of 3 phases:

    1. **Concept Design Phase**:
        - The contractor is required to develop three (3) concept designs for the exhibition, which must include **floorplans**, **elevations**, and **presentation renderings**. These deliverables can be provided as **CAD drawings in PDF format.**
    2. **Design Development Phase**:
        - During the design development phase, refined floorplans and elevations showing object placements and display elements will be needed. This phase will involve detailed **case and wall layouts**, which will likely benefit from CAD modeling to ensure precision.
    3. **Final Design Phase**:
        - The final design package must include **dimensioned drawings and elevations**, specifications for **new casework**, and other exhibit elements. This will almost certainly require 3D modeling tools to provide the necessary **detailed visualizations and technical specifications.**
- **Evaluation Criteria**
    - It’s a best-value trade-off RFP, so both technical approach and pricing will be critical.
    - Past performance will play a significant role, with a questionnaire included to evaluate the contractor's suitability.
- **Accessibility & Compliance**
    - The design must comply with ADA, ABA, and Section 508 accessibility requirements. The RFP references guidelines from the National Park Service to ensure exhibits are inclusive.
    - Familiarity with museum-quality standards and the Library’s specific security and conservation requirements will be important.
- **Design Phases**
    - The process will be iterative, requiring regular feedback and adjustments at every stage. Clear milestones are set for concept, design development, and final production.
- **Bidding / Pricing**
    - Deliverables are to be priced on a firm-fixed basis, and your proposal needs to provide a price for each specified deliverable.

# Entity Structure

---

For this project, Telos Affinity Group LLC (TAG) will hire Lawan (if he’s interested) as an independent contractor to **lead the design and execution** of the **Founding Phrases** exhibition at the Library of Congress. As the lead, you’ll be working directly with Trent, who will serve as a key member of the project management and design team. Together, you and Trent will collaborate on the exhibit’s layout, graphic design, and technical specifications.

Additionally, TAG will bring in other specialists as needed, depending on the complexity and requirements of each project phase. This means that while you'll lead the design, you may work alongside other contractors or vendors we hire for specific tasks like 3D modeling, CAD development, or fabrication.
