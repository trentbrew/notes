# Black Owned Small Business and Nonprofit Legal Clinic Intake Form

The Arts & Business Council of Greater Nashville's ("ABC") Volunteer Lawyers and Professionals for the Arts ("VLPA") program and Bradley's Nashville office are partnering to present monthly Black-Owned Small Business and Non-profit Legal Clinics providing accessible and affordable business-oriented legal services. Lawyers will provide help with corporate governance, review of contracts, and guidance in navigating local ordinances and state regulations.

Clinic appointments are first come, first served and offered on the third Thursday of each month (except December, when it is hosted earlier because of the holidays). Limited appointments are available and registration closes on the Monday prior to each clinic.

If you have any questions while completing this form, please reach out to our team at [vlpa@abcnashville.org](mailto:vlpa@abcnashville.org).

**Please Note:** This form is for the Black Owned Business Clinic in Nashville, TN. Bradley also hosts a similar clinic in Birmingham, AL, in partnership with Legal Services Alabama.
