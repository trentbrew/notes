**[Tutorial Script: Managing Events in Your Notion Calendar]**

---

**Introduction**

Hello! In this tutorial, I’m going to show you how to add new events to your Notion calendar, explain what each event property means, and guide you through editing existing events. With this setup, your events will automatically update on your Webflow site as well, so managing everything in one place will save you time!

Let’s get started!

## **Step 1: Accessing the Notion Calendar**

1. **Open Notion**
   - Log in to Notion using your email and password, or open the Notion app if you’re using it on your desktop or mobile device.

2. **Navigate to your Events Calendar**
   - Once logged in, locate the 'Events Calendar' page in your Notion workspace. It should display the familiar calendar view, like what you see when you open Google Calendar or iCal.

## **Step 2: Adding a New Event**

1. **Select a Date**
   - To create a new event, hover over the date on the calendar and click the ‘+’ button that appears on that date. This will open a new event window.

2. **Fill in Event Details**
   - In the new event window, you will see several fields (properties) that need to be filled out. Here’s what each one means:

   - **Event Title**: The name of your event. Be specific so it’s easily recognizable.

   - **Date & Time**: Choose the date of your event. You can also set start and end times by toggling on the ‘End Date’ and ‘Time’ options if needed.

   - **Location**: Add where the event will take place, whether it's a physical address or a virtual meeting link.

   - **Event Type**: Use this field to categorize your event. For example, is it a 'Meeting,' 'Workshop,' or 'Presentation'? You can select from predefined categories or add new ones.

   - **Organizer**: Assign the person or team responsible for this event. This could be yourself or another team member.

   - **Description**: Add details or notes about the event. This is where you can include an agenda, goals, or any other important information.

   - **Visibility**: If relevant, set whether the event is public (shown on the Webflow calendar) or private (for internal use only).

3. **Save the Event**
   - Once you’ve filled in all the necessary details, simply close the window. Notion saves automatically. Your event will now appear in the calendar and, thanks to the Zapier integration, will automatically update on your Webflow site.

## **Step 3: Editing an Existing Event**

1. **Find the Event**
   - Scroll through your calendar or use the search function to find the event you want to edit.

2. **Open the Event**
   - Click on the event, and it will reopen the window with all the event details.

3. **Make Your Edits**
   - You can edit any of the fields (event title, date, time, location, etc.). If the event has changed in any way, update the information accordingly.

4. **Save Your Changes**
   - Once again, simply close the window after making your edits, and your changes will be saved automatically. These updates will be reflected on the Webflow site as well.
