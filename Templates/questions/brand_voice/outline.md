- **Current Problems:** Clients in the interiors business face barriers, feeling like failures for not being able to design their homes themselves. EWH aims to solve this by making clients feel the design is truly theirs, acting as a cheerleader in the process.

### Brand Struggles

- **Unclear Elements:** The blend of personal aesthetic (bold), personality (warm, goofy, playful), and business identity (supportive services) is challenging. Despite this, EWH possesses a strong visual language.

### Value Proposition

- **Unique Offer:** EWH believes everyone deserves a beautiful home, defined and co-created with the client, emphasizing a supportive, healing approach with gentleness, humor, and zero judgment.

### Business Goals

- **Core Belief:** Authenticity in self and home design is paramount. The process aims to be pleasant, joyful, and sometimes introspective, avoiding any perception of unreliability or promptness issues.

## Audience

### Demographics

- **Current Audience:** Families, particularly women aged 45-55 with a high education level and a household income in the $500K range, looking to invest in beauty and restoration for their homes.
- **Desired Audience:** Continuation of the current demographic, with a focus on fun-money budgets and a dream to design for trans teens needing a new room to reflect their identity.

### Location and Relationship

- **Geography:** Primarily Chicago and other metropolitan areas.
- **Connection:** Most clients are friends or acquaintances, fostering a personal connection and shared ethos.

### Communication

- **Tone:** Warm and respectful, with a shift towards more professionalism, especially in communication methods, moving from text to email.

### Design Preferences
