Hey [Recipient Name],

I am connecting you with [Contact Name], a talented web & digital designer I've had the pleasure of working with over the past few years. [Contact Name] has expressed a keen interest in contributing to client work at [Company Name], particularly in areas of graphic design, 3D design, marketing, branding, and creative strategy.

Given our recent discussions about delegating more responsibilities to focus on internal initiatives, and the alignment of [Contact Name]'s skillset with our current needs, I believe [Contact Name] could be a valuable addition to the team.

[Contact Name] has put together some additional examples of their graphic design work for your reference which can be found [Link Here]. They are CC'd on this email for you to chat with them directly.

Let me know if there's anything I can do to further support!

Best,

[Your Name]
