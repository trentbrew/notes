Dude that's rad!! How are you liking LA? If you're around for new years lemme know if you want to meet up for coffee or something!

That sounds rad man

I have been good man!

Somehow have managed to find semi consistent work haha. Landed with a good crew in town and they've been taking care of me which has been great!
I got a job working in the camera department on Dark Matter Season 2, this Apple TV show.

My boss hit me up about an idea he had for what seemed to me like a simple front end for a web interface to control a camera, and I thought, I know the perfect person to make that!

This is the web interface of the camera - we are looking to have an IOS app act as the front end for it because the web interface isn't really usable on an iPhone unfortunately.
Obviously can pay, but we don't have much money! Let me know if this is something that interests you!

This is an example of the web Ul on an iPhone 13 Mini - not the best...

Ayye congrats on the gig!

I had a look at the references you sent and I really appreciate the detailed breakdown. I would definitely be interested in working on this! I do have a few questions for you though.

If you have some of this information please feel free to share, otherwise we can discuss in detail over the call:
- Is the existing web UI a third party product, or was it custom built? If custom, who is the developer, and is it open source?
- Who is the target audience for the web UI? What is their role in the production process?
- Are there any specific features you're looking to implement that aren't part of the existing web UI?
- Is there a timeline you're targeting for the project?
- Can you provide information about the cameras your team is working with?

These are top of mind questions, and more will definitely surface as we discuss in detail.

I actually just got back to Chicago from St. Louis last night, but I'll be flying back to LA tomorrow evening for Thanksgiving. I'm planning to be back in Chicago for new years though. Let me know if you'd want to meet up to discuss this further tomorrow morning/afternoon, or if Zoom / Google Meet would work better for you.

Thanks for having me in mind for this üôèüèæ Looking forward to hearing from you!
