Do you do any UI/UX design stuff? I'm looking to hire a designer for a project I've been working on for several months but so far it's all just default Flutter/Material and it needs a UX review and facelift before releasing it.

Hey 👋🏾 It's great to hear from you(: I’d love to learn more about the project. Feel free to send a brief to my email (hello@trentbrew.com) if you have one. Also, I’m open to a discovery call sometime after Thanksgiving to catch up and figure out how a collaboration might look. Let me know a good time for you.
