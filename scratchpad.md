Games ocupy the same space as dance in my mind. They are both curious kinds of things.

Dance is a kind of art. At the same time it's a kind of sport, a form of communicationâ€“an experience. Dancers are athletes as much as they are artists.

Much like dance, games are a kind of art and a kind of sport. They're opposite of dance in that they're typically competitive, where dance is about cooperation and coordination.

Games are interesting because they're also a kind of tool. A powerful one. Maybe the most powerful one there is.
