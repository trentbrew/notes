# Matthew

_Context_

Matthew Manning, founder and creative director of Gumbo Media, has been an incredible mentor since I joined the team 20 months ago. What started as freelance illustration work blossomed into a full-time role where I've grown immensely through diverse creative projects. His leadership and guidance have deeply impacted my professional journey.

As Matthew celebrates his first Christmas as a father, I'm filled with gratitude for all he's done. This feels like the perfect moment to express my heartfelt appreciation for his mentorship and the opportunities he's provided at Gumbo.

Though we've recently grown apart due to a falling out, I want to express my sincere apologies, let her know she's missed and loved, and that my door remains open whenever she's ready.
