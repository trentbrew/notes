1. Writing the Truth is Hard: Early drafts are rough approximations to the truth. Achieving clarity and truthfulness requires extensive revising and a commitment to making each sentence sharper and more believable.

2. Good Writing is Good Psychology: Writing effectively involves understanding the relationship between the reader and the text. This means building a psychology of reading where every rule or advice serves to enhance this relationship.

3. Beware of Using Unfamiliar Words: Words not used in regular speech can alienate readers unless their use is carefully justified and serves the reader's understanding.

4. Clarity of Purpose: A well-written piece has a clear, singular purpose. Everything in the writing, including digressions, should serve this overarching goal.

5. Question of Purpose: A compelling answer to what the book or essay is about is crucial. Lack of a clear, overriding purpose can make the piece feel aimless.

6. Occam's Razor for Writing: Simpler, shorter passages are usually better because they tend to be clearer and more vivid.

7. Hemingway's Advice: Start writing by finding one true sentence you believe in, and proceed from there. Also, stop writing when you still know what happens next, so you're never stuck.

8. Exploring Beyond Boundaries: Sometimes, exploring topics or ideas outside the initial purpose is necessary. This requires understanding how it fits into the overall purpose of your piece.

9. Title and Chapter Title Considerations: Effective titles often juxtapose unexpected concepts or are striking and memorable. Chapter titles should also reflect the content and purpose of the chapters.

10. Opening Sentences: The first sentence should engage the reader immediately, starting as late as possible in the story or argument to maintain interest.

11. Danger Words and Phrases: Words like "interesting," "quite," and "very" are often overused and can weaken prose. They should be used sparingly or replaced with more precise language.

12. Structure and Classic Style: Effective structure and adherence to classic style can enhance clarity and engagement. However, personal exploration and understanding of the subject matter are necessary before attempting classic style.

13. Avoiding Cliches: Writers should strive to avoid conventional stories and cliches, seeking original expressions and perspectives to provide fresh insights and engage readers.

14. Note-taking and Prefaces: Effective note-taking and thoughtful prefaces can significantly contribute to the writing process, providing clarity and context for the reader.
