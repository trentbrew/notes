Dear Dr. Sal,

I hope you are well. My name is Trent, and I am seeking a new psychiatrist due to a recent change in my insurance. I have been under psychiatric care for OCD, ADHD, and social anxiety and am currently on medication that has been effective in managing these conditions. However, due to my insurance change, I am unable to continue seeing my previous psychiatrist and am looking to transition to a new provider before the end of the year. I am interested in scheduling an initial consultation to discuss the continuity of my care, including medication management and any other recommended treatments. My goal is to ensure a smooth transition and to maintain the stability that I have achieved with my current treatment plan. For scheduling, I am available any time after 11 am PST during weekdays, and I am also open to weekend appointments if that fits your schedule. Below are my contact details for your convenience: Email: hello@trentbrew.com Phone: +1 636 515 1293 Thank you very much for considering my request. I am looking forward to the possibility of working with you and appreciate your assistance in this transition.

Warm regards,
Trent Brew
