It sounds like you're navigating some important decisions about how to approach your grant application. Since Turtle Labs LLC encompasses Docket.tv along with your other projects, applying for the grant under Turtle Labs LLC would likely be the most strategic approach. This way, you can emphasize the breadth and variety of innovative projects your company is working on, not just Docket.tv.

Applying as Turtle Labs LLC also allows you to present a unified, professional front as a business entity, which might be more appealing to grant committees interested in funding established organizations rather than individual projects. Moreover, this approach doesn't limit the potential use of the funds to just one project, giving you flexibility to allocate resources across your various initiatives as needed.

In your application, you can still highlight Docket.tv as a key project that demonstrates your companyâ€™s current focus and potential for impact, while also mentioning your other projects to show the depth and diversity of your portfolio. This could strengthen your application by showing the range of your creativity and technical expertise.

If the grant application allows for it, consider including an overview or a roadmap of Turtle Labs LLC's future plans, to give the reviewers a sense of the growth and trajectory of your business. This could help them see the broader value in supporting your entire suite of projects.
