### Introduction

The Tree of Thought (ToT) technique is a method for organizing and storing information in a hierarchical tree structure. It was developed by [Dr. John F. Sowa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Sowa) as a way to represent knowledge in a form that is both human-readable and machine-readable. The ToT technique has been used in a variety of applications, including [knowledge representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning), [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing), and [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence). In this post, we will discuss how XML could be used as a local tree of memory for [LLMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifelogging) (lifelogging machines) in the context of the ToT technique.
