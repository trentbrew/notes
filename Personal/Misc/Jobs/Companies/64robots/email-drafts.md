# CONTEXT

You're looking for a front-end engineering job as a Vue developer and you come across a company that checks all of your boxes (culture, tech stack, diversity, mission, etc). You apply in May, but you don't hear back for a while. 3 months later in August, one of the partners of the company reaches out to you and informs you that they're hiring again, and is wondering if you're still looking/interested. 

You briefly let him know that you're still interested. You try your best to keep your communication concise and clear, as not to ramble away the opportunity. You send this response within an hour of receiving the message, in hopes that you he will get back to you the following Monday, or sometime the following week.

Your original application from May is a bit out-dated, so you're thinking of doing a few things: 
1.) You want to send an updated resume with relevant links.
2.) You want to ask some clarifying questions in case the role/requirements/job description has changed.
3.) You want to express your enthusiasm without coming across as overzealous or scatter-brained.
4.) You want to be playfully professional, and true to yourself.
5.) You especially want to be concise and strait to the point.
6.) You want to show gratitude for their time and for the opportunity, and for keeping you in their rolodex in case of an opening.
7.) You want to express why you find the company so compelling, and your admiration for the team's creativity, diversity, craft, and problem solving.
8.) You want to take the initiative on scheduling next steps, while remaining humble, staying in your lane, and keeping your hands off the wheel.
9.) You don't want to bring up pay or salary just yet.
10.) You want them to feel confident you're the right guy for the job.

You really want this job, and you don't wanna screw up the easy part (communicating via email).

You're typically overly verbose, and it takes you a while to get to the point. You want to become a more effective communicator by being more concise, clear, quick, and strait to the point. You want to master the balance of taking enough time to formulate an appropriate response, while at the same time responding as soon as you possibly can.
