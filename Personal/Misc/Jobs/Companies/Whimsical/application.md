I feel lucky to have discovered this opportunity through read.cv because it combines my passion for design, user experience, and front-end development with the opportunity to contribute to a company that values craftsmanship and building exceptional software.

In my past experience I've collaborated with remote teams across timezones, using communication tools to stay connected and organized. I believe asynchronous work requires a balance of concentration and communication. As a developer, I understand that building flow takes ample space & heads down time, and I believe asynchronous work lends itself to this. I also believe that communication is key to building a strong team, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my communication skills.

I've worked as a web developer for the past few years but I've recently found solace in digital design & illustration. The design process feels playful and meditative, and I feel lucky to spend more time these days being creative. I'm currently balancing a few freelance projects spanning web design, full-stack development, and eCommerce. As the sole developer on these projects it's challenging but liberating to be hands on across the stack, and approach implementation from a design perspective.
