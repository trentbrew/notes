Hello Restream Team,

I am thrilled at the prospect of joining Restream, particularly to bring my experience from developing Docket.tv (https://docket.tv) — a tool I crafted to transform how broadcasters engage with their audiences through a customizable TV Guide CMS. This project is currently in Alpha and the CMS features are not yet available to the public, but it has been a lot of fun to work on and it has been a great learning experience. This project not only honed my skills in UX design and JavaScript but also deepened my commitment to creating solutions that enhance user interaction and accessibility in digital broadcasting.

At Restream, I am eager to leverage this expertise to contribute to your team and learn from your work. I would love for the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute at Restream, and am reachable via email at hello@trentbrew.com or by phone at +1 636 515 1293. My portfolio and CV can be found at https://trentbrew.com.

Thank you for your time and consideration!

– Trenton
