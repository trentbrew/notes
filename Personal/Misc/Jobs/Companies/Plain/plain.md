We are building the support platform for developer tools. Think Linear meets Stripe for support: A pro tool that’s delightful to use right out of the box, and powerful to build with.

Support might seem boring at first, but we think it’s one of the most interesting products to work on. Support tools are the very definition of a productivity tool. They’re inherently multiplayer, high volume and collaborative with unique technical demands. Plus, every company that has customers, has customer support - a huge software market.

We’re looking for an experienced backend engineer to help us lead and shape all things backend at Plain. You'll be joining an intentionally small, commercially savvy, and product-centric team. Everyone on our team is technical, commits code, and speaks to customers. We maintain complete internal transparency on almost everything, and are just as driven by building a great product as we are by building a great company.

What you'll do
Shape our architecture. You'll work on some of our most complex technical challenges and help others do the same. You'll help decide how we build things and what we prioritise as a product and engineering team.

Guide product direction: We believe that all engineering decisions are product decisions, and vice versa. You'll collaborate with everyone on the team to decide what we work on and why, and help build Plain to be the best product and business it can be.

Help build a small team with outsized impact: We want to build an intentionally small company because we believe that small teams are more efficient than big teams. You'll play an integral role in shaping our product, culture and ways of working to enable this.

Create a stellar developer experience. You'll help make sure the experience of building with Plain second to none. You'll play a key role in everything from how we structure our data model through to designing our APIs and writing documentation.

This is a great fit if you…
Enjoy being hands-on with a focus on writing code and shipping things. There is a lot to build.

Want to work day-to-day in a full-stack Typescript and serverless codebase.

Want to work as part of a small, multi-disciplinary team and collaborate closely with others.

Want to work on something (nearly) greenfield. The biggest product and company decisions still lie ahead of us.

Enjoy the autonomy, uncertainty and unpredictability that comes with an early stage company.

This won't be the right role if you…
Want to manage a team. Given our team growth plans, this is unlikely to be a need in the next 12-24 months.

Mainly want to deepen your expertise in a particular technology or domain. This role is best for product and business focused engineers.

Want all of the benefits that come with an established tech company - top-end comp, free drinks and lunches, etc.

Want a traditional product team set up, with a predictable roadmap, clearly scoped out tickets, a PM, and so forth.
