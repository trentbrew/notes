Description
Teton is building AI technology that helps nurses and other front line care staff deliver more and better care while stressing less.

The solution helps hospitals and care homes to continue to deliver critical care and patient safety even when faced with the present world-wide shortage of nurses. At Teton we operate differently than traditional companies in the field, by having a focus both on high quality software, but also the service and implementation around it. At one of the hospitals we set up at last year we reduced falls in their ward by 84%, while also getting overwhelmingly positive feedback from the staff. In 3 years, we have developed and commercialized a full fledged AI product, used by health care workers everyday in a fast-growing number of hospitals and care homes.

This job is in-person in our office in Copenhagen, Denmark.

Role & Required Skills
Weâ€™re looking to find a second designer for our company. Itâ€™ll be you and Julius (head of design, and the person writing this job description), working across all aspects of design in the company. At this stage of our company, weâ€™re looking for an experienced generalist, whoâ€™ll be able to confidently navigate the different aspects of the product. Most time will be spent on the desktop/mobile apps, but youâ€™ll also get to be hands on with the website and branding, as well developing the service elements of the product (such as staff onboarding, and hardware installation).

To thrive in this role, we believe you have experience in:

At least 3 years of experience in digital product design, with a strong portfolio showcasing successful projects.

Demonstrated experience in prototyping new software. Using whatever tools you might need to get there, such as Figma, Framer, Origami, Blender, After Effects and/or SwiftUI.

An opinionated approach to branding and visual design, and an ability to translate those visions to reality.

A balance of platform-scale vision and obsessive detail orientation.

A product oriented mindset, that allows you to balance market and user needs.

Representative projects

Frequently spending time at Hospitals and Care Homes to understand end-user needs and integrate their perspective into the development of the product.

Rapidly prototype different products and services to help solve real problems for users.

Sitting side by side with engineers to develop and fine tune the features you are building.

Working closely with the sales and business teams to help them if they need material for communicating or selling the product.

How is it to work at Teton?
We are a tight, but growing, team of extremely hard working and talented people. The learning curves are steep and expanding oneâ€™s skill set is encouraged. Itâ€™s a workplace where you get your hands dirty and learn a lot. If you are looking for the vibe of large corporations, this is not the place for you, but if you like to build products and strive to be the best in your field, we believe that Teton is a place where you will thrive.

What we offer:
All full-time employees at Teton are offered the opportunity to be part of a warrant program (stock options) in the company in addition to your salary. We recently closed our second funding round and are offering sizable warrant packages.

You get to work with state-of-the-art technology and be a pioneer within your field.

Weâ€™re looking for a teammate
We are looking for people who believe in our long-term vision and value ownership and entrepreneurship rather than just another 9-5 job.

With us you will have an opportunity to truly make an impact on the world with the outcomes of your work. So, if you are looking for a ride not just a job â€“ jump on board ðŸ˜Š
