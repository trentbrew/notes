Hi Trenton,

Thank you for letting us know about this. For security reasons, we’ve disabled the ability for anyone to log into your account from your email address at this time. We have also temporarily disabled payouts.

That said, we would like to give access back to your account and secure it after a quick call to verify a few details of the current account representative originally listed on your account.

The account representative will need to have access to a device connected to the internet during the call so that they can log back in while on the line. Please keep in mind that on this call we can only speak to the account representative that’s currently listed on the Stripe account with the initials of "T.B." (redacted for security purposes). And we can also only call the phone number ending with 1293 listed on the account.

Please let us know the time and the time zone that works for the account representative, and we'll reach out then.

Kind regards,

Khalil

Hello Stripe Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

My name is Trenton Brew. I am a web developer based in Chicago, IL and I use Stripe to manage my client invoices, online stores, and SAAS subscriptions under Turtle Labs LLC.

I am reaching out because I was locked out of my Stripe account today at 2:50pm CT.

I suspect this happend because I logged into Stripe on my client's personal laptop yesterday (7/10/2024) to help setup a connected account to manage her online store. Based on the attached email (ID: em_awpkrmplil87wi9yfvn0r3dvnb8uuf), I see that the client has changed the email address on my Stripe account from `hello@trentbrew.com` to `kianijeedesign@gmail.com`, and the password has been changed as well.

The client has been unresponsive and I am not able to reset the password as I do not have access to the email address that the account is now linked to.

I hope the following information can help me recover access to my Stripe account:

Hi Aldo,

Thank you very much for your assistance in transferring the ownership of my accounts. I appreciate your help and the quick resolution.

However, I have noticed that my payouts are still paused. Could you please let me know if there is anything I need to do to unpause the payouts? I would like to ensure that my account is fully operational as soon as possible.

Thank you again for your support.

Best regards,
Trenton Brew
