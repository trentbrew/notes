Hi Trent -

I hope you‚Äôve been enjoying this holiday month so far. I wanted to send a quick update on future workstreams for Gumbo. Per some of the updates I‚Äôve recently shared about our need to get more nimble into the new year, we‚Äôll be trimming down most of our services efforts into the hands of a few core folks from the existing team.

If interested, I would love for you to be one of our two primary graphic designer, as well as one of two primary web designers. You‚Äôd be more of a generalist that floats between both capacities. This means you‚Äôd be part of a core 10 or so folks who will be responsible for the bulk of corresponding work coming through our pipeline in the new year. As always, you‚Äôll be a contractor and will still have lots of flexibility to choose whether or not you‚Äôre interested in taking on the proposed work. Our goal is simply to better streamline efficiency and quality control‚Äîand narrowing our core team for services will help build that consistency and familiarity over time. And in that process we‚Äôre prioritizing the folks who are 1) more dependent on the work for sustainability; 2) the folks who have shown a consistent and active commitment to Gumbo‚Äôs clients; and/or 3) have consistently delivered excellent work for our clients.

All other existing contractors within Gumbo who are not part of that core 10 will still be part of Gumbo. But they‚Äôll be extended work more exclusively when 1) our pipeline is too robust for the core; 2) the core team doesn‚Äôt have the time or interest; or 3) when projects are broad enough in scope that it demands it.

If you‚Äôre interested in being more heavily prioritized for future work with Gumbo, please let me know. No immediate rush, as we‚Äôre now in holiday season and won‚Äôt dive back into work until the New Year. But come early January, I hope to have clarity on how to proceed.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Much love.
Matthew

Hey! Sorry to hit you up over the holidays. Quick question. Generally, do you feel comfortable taking on SEO and Google Ads work? Do you have a model for this?

# Trent:

Hey Matthew, I don't currently have a model in place for these, but I'm very interested in developing these skills. I've started looking into some resources and courses to get up to speed. So, while I may not have immediate expertise, I'm enthusiastic about learning and expanding my capabilities in these areas. I found some resources and certifications through [Google Skillshop](https://skillshop.exceedlms.com/student/catalog/list?category_ids=2844-google-ads-certifications) I can pursue to get up to speed. Happy to begin training on these if it would be helpful.

Regarding your email on workflow updates, I'm definitely interested in being more heavily prioritized for future work with Gumbo. I'm happy to be a generalist that floats between graphic/web design, and I'm honored be considered as one of the primary digital designers. üôáüèæ I'm happy to contribute in whatever capacity is most helpful to you and the team.
