# Merely a Reflection

this isn't a poem, at least i don't think.

it's just a few thoughts about things about me, about us, about them and the things that we see in ourselves.

observations, reflections on self-preservation and the parts of ourselves we construct to obsess with a check.

your value is yours let it be what it's meant to become.

take care of your fervor, be well with your grind and be kindly aggressive time.

it's loud when I hear it.

my flaw is the same phony that they tax from

your wealth is your blessings, your health is your time, your craft is your gift, what you give is your life

all i want is to be for my self at age 3 all the things we when we're young and we're free

---

I know that I'm selfish for saving the crumbs for myself but I'm cooking for us

give them a reason to be their best reason to be

I draw queen of hearts with the crumbs of my craft.

It's a skill to pretend to be happy with napping on saturday mornings

Your fruits that I found when I studied the roots of the reason it is that I do what I do.

I draw queen of hearts in pursuit of the truth. I don't mind the not knowing,

I love what I don't understand, like myself. Like the way that you use me

It takes time to feel fine without us.

I learn just enough to see you in myself and that sucks.

A bundle of 26 synapses meant to be eaten aliven

---

I eat vapors and sip brewed beverages about the next thing I'll make to make

---

I learn how when I make things, especially for you.

Something clicks when I make you the centerpiece.

---

if you're making it to something you actually want.

unless it's for you.

I digress.

I don't write. Words are hard. I'm a visual thinker.

I don't feel like an artist I just like to tinker.

My work is for free. The line kind. Take a part of my soul.

but I help paint make its way to the place it came from

I draw when I'm compelled to. It helps me understand myself.

---

I do have a name, but if you're here then you know it.

To be frank, I'm a trainwreck. I try not to show it.

I don't write but at this point in life I have to master my mind.

---

Little Trent is still me but less loud about talents.

Good at stuff

Showing-off gets annoying and

I overcorrected

Windows 95 Game Maker 8

Reticent 26 results of excessive synapses

The word "gifted" started to feel like

Dissonant culture fit.

Dim

The opposite of his twin.

Not that there's much to show, only ones & zeros.

The occasional paint job.

til the sun makes the world loud

You probably know my face, and the things that I make.

I'm happy you're here

I tend to not talk much. I listen more than I speak. I think more than I feel.

I'm an artist.

I don't rush.

Potentialessness became the backwards way.
