Hello Payal,

No worries! I realized I misread our booking for tomorrow at 11 AM and accidentally overbooked for this afternoon. Could we possibly reschedule for tomorrow or any time during the week of October 7th to kick off our discovery session?

Please let me know which times suit you best that week, and I'll arrange to send a calendar invite promptly.

Looking forward to our conversation!

Best regards,

Trenton Brew
