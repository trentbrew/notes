Hi Dr. Ashley,

I hope you're doing well.

Thank you again for your continued patience as I work through some updates with Gumbo regarding our collaboration. As you know, the Ops Team and I have been discussing the best way to manage our ongoing work for project success. As a freelancer, I'm committed to providing you with the best possible service and ensuring your needs are met â€“ However, I believe The Rolling Archives is a monumental project both technically and influentially, deserving a stellar team behind it to ensure it's longevity and reach. I sincerely believe the best way to make this happen is to route your retainer through Gumbo Media.

With this arrangement I'll still have the pleasure of getting to work with you, while project management, primary communication, invoicing, etc will be routed through Gumbo. This will allow me to focus on the creative aspects of the project, leveraging the full breadth of Gumbo's resources and expertise. There are still some unknowns on my end regarding potential changes to the retainer model but Matthew and I will be meeting next Wednesday to finalize the details.

I want to emphasize that this arrangement is ultimately your call and your feedback is paramount. I'm fully open to your thoughts and preferences. Please feel free to share any concerns or questions you might have, or if you prefer, we can arrange a call to discuss this in more detail.

Regardless of how we structure our work, my top priority is to ensure The Rolling Archives has the resources it needs to remain a thriving source of inspiration and empowerment for generations to come.

I'll be reaching out with an update after our call on Wednesday, and as always, I'm available to answer any questions you may have via email or phone. Thank you once again for your

Abundantly,
