# Overview

The Mask Project is a creative exploration that aims to visually represent the themes and narratives of Dr. Erin D. Chapman's work as a historian specializing in African American history, particularly focusing on African

# Background

Gumbo Media proposes a website design for Dr. Erin D Chapman, PhD. The website will function independently of her university to promote, advocate, and expand her work, influence, and professional opportunities. Our approach combines strategic expertise, design acumen, and inclusive values to create a professional digital presence that honors her contributions to Black histories, particularly for Black women.

# The Mask Project

The Mask Project will use the rich symbolism of masks to create visual narratives that encapsulate Dr. Erin's scholarship on the Black experience. Each mask will represent different facets of her work, such as race, gender, political activism, and historical analysis, blending traditional African and modern artistic influences. These masks will be part of an interactive gallery on her website, offering a fresh, engaging way to explore her themes.

# **Key Elements:**

1. **Masks as Symbolic Vessels:**
    - Each mask could represent a different domain of Dr. Erin's scholarship, with each one embodying aspects of the Black experience she explores—be it race, gender, sexuality, or the intersection of these within cultural, political, and historical contexts.
    - The use of masks is poignant, as it can convey the duality of public and private personas, the necessity of "code-switching," and the historical impositions on Black identity.
2. **Broad Aesthetic Palette:**
    - While rooted in the visual language of African masks, the designs would also incorporate influences from Art Deco, Aaron Douglas's silhouetted figures, and Kara Walker's stark, narrative silhouettes. This would allow the masks to serve as bridges between various cultural and artistic traditions, much like the way Dr. Erin's work spans multiple disciplines and contexts.
    - The aesthetic would be less about strict cultural representation and more about a fusion of styles that speak to the multiplicity of the Black experience across time and space.
3. **Individual Identities:**
    - Each mask could have its own unique character and visual identity, reflecting the different aspects of Dr. Erin's studies. For instance:
        - **Art & Cultural History Mask**: This could blend Art Deco patterns with African motifs, perhaps incorporating the stylized, dynamic lines of Aaron Douglas.
        - **Gender & Sexuality Mask**: This could have softer, more fluid lines, drawing inspiration from Kara Walker's work, with a focus on the dualities and complexities of identity.
        - **Political Activism Mask**: This might have bolder, more angular shapes, perhaps with elements inspired by protest art or the iconography of resistance.
        - **Historical Analysis Mask**: A more textured, layered design, symbolizing the depth and complexity of historical study, possibly incorporating archival elements or references to historical documentation.
4. **Metaphorical and Aesthetic Exploration:**
    - The masks wouldn’t be just aesthetic objects but also carriers of narratives—each one telling a story or capturing a specific facet of the Black experience.
    - The interplay between visibility and invisibility, power and vulnerability, tradition and modernity, could be explored through how each mask is designed and presented.
5. **Digital Execution:**
    - In their digital form, these masks could be highly stylized, even abstract, to allow for creative interpretation. You could experiment with textures, colors, and forms that evoke the themes without being too literal.
    - The masks could be presented as part of a digital gallery on her website, perhaps even interactively, allowing visitors to explore the stories behind each design.
