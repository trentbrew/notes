Hey Trent!

Hope you’re having a great couple of weeks back from the holidays. Thanks for all the great convos to date.

I just wanted to update you on a couple of workflows for some of the current projects, as our shifts to the team mean also reassessing current projects and the necessary changes to make things slightly more nimble heading into this new year. I’m imagining you had some questions about how these recent updates impact your current projects anyway.

With this reprioritization of team efforts, and your heightened focus on internal Gumbo builds, we’d like to collapse some of the design outputs and efforts across current projects. The primary one impacted will be Living Cities. We anticipate the social media efforts ramping down slightly, so we’re looking at ways to collapse the 5-6 person services team for this project down to about 2-3 people.

Specifically, for you, I propose transitioning you off the project to focus more on the 2-4 Gumbo projects instead (Bronzeville Blues, Gumbo site, Blackwords.co, GumboFit). Sandi would take over the regular workflow instead. There would likely still be some needs in design from you on that project, but I’d like to limit those to more of the specialty projects. We’re making a big concerted effort to streamline communication and efficiency on the Living Cities project (it’s currently a bit too unwieldy), and Sandi and Nick have an established workflow between each other and with this specific client already. I apologize for the mid-project switch-up, but I’m just doing everything I can to get more nimble and set the full team (you included) better up for long-term success.

This means you’d also be top priority for other incoming work (potential large-scale RFPs and fun community-based projects), of which there are some exciting opportunities. More on that soon!

We don’t know enough about SPEAK MPLS yet, as this project is still ramping up and we’re just waiting to hear back from the client as she comes back from the holidays. But there may be a similar transition there, as it sounds like Rebecca (the client) wants to propose some structural changes to the scope in this new year. So I’m not even sure if the same team will make sense. I will keep you updated as I learn more.

In the meantime, I will focus on paying you out for December and will keep you up to date on new services opportunities in the coming weeks—not to mention all the fun internal projects we’re working on.

Appreciate you, and let me know if you have any questions!
