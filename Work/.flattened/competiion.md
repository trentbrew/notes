There are several AI writing tools specifically tailored for grant writing and government contract proposals:

1. **Grantboost**: This tool is designed specifically to help nonprofit organizations streamline the grant writing process. It provides resources, support, and guidance for managing grant proposals and tracking progress[1].

2. **Unicorn Copilot**: Developed by Learn Grant Writing, this AI assistant is designed for professional grant writers. It helps with various stages of the grant writing process, including research, preparation, and proposal writing[2].

3. **ChatGPT**: While not exclusively for grant writing, ChatGPT can be used to generate high-quality grant proposals quickly and efficiently. It offers a chat-like interface that makes it easy for users to create and refine grant-related content[1][6].

These tools are part of a growing niche that leverages AI to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of grant writing, helping organizations secure funding more effectively.
