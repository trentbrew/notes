Hey, @Trent Brew! It was so wonderful to meet you this afternoon! I'm looking forward to working with you on this project. Here are a few screen caps to capture the overall design with the portal. Please disregard the name that is written until we confirm for sure. Oh, also, this is a small thing but if we could alphabetize the portal names in that column that would be awesome. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out!

Hey team @here. Happy Tuesday! Our audit of all expressed needs is going well. It did also raise some other issues (opportunities for website optimization, particularly in the mobile experience), which Trent is drafting for you now. We're going to cleanly outline this for you, as well as some opportunities for addressing them, which means we'll be sending over that document by EOD instead of by Noon. More very soon!

Thank you, Matthew!

Hi team @here! I hope you've had a pleasant day. I'm sharing two quick audits here for your review:
1. Website edit questions + updates for your review in order to complete existing scope (primary focus)
2. Lighthouse SEO report, outlining opportunities for performance, per our conversation about SEO optimization services at the tail end of our last call.
You don't have to focus much on the second audit right now, but we did want to share it, as it will inform the scope addendum we discussed for some additional (light) services. Some additional thoughts to come on the scoping piece, but for now, let's make sure we get all questions answered for Trent so that we can complete the site edits. I will share the rest tomorrow.

Good Morning, @Matthew! Thank you for sharing the audit. I'm not sure if we expressed this in our last meeting but the portal creation is the more urgent priority than the website edits. We are still determining a due date for this but if it's possible to have the portal created by August 7th (or earlier) that would be extremely helpful. I know we still need to provide the content but I just wanted to name that here. Also, I'm hoping you could help me with something. I went to add some stakeholders to our SEL Curriculum this morning and I got a message saying "Error Establishing A Database Connection". Could you please assist? Thank you!

Hello team, I'm having trouble accessing the backend as well. Investigating this now.

Hey, all! I was just able to log into the back end of our website so I think we're good to go there!

**Matthew**
*4:27 PM*
Awesome. Thanks for the notice. @Trent Brew, can you also let us know what you discovered, if anything? (edited)

Good Morning, @Matthew and @Trent Brew! Here are the answers to your questions in the assessment for the new portal that needs to be created:
*9:04 AM*
- Are the resources for this page ready to be added? Not yet, work in progress - will be ready by 8/6
- Who exactly should have access to this section? NewRoot Staff and designated school stakeholders
- Users should be required to login to view these resources, correct? Correct
- What should the page be called? Restorative Practices Toolkit
*9:05 AM*
Given our answers and having content by 8/6, can you please give an estimated time you think the portal will be ready to add the content?

**Trent Brew**
*8/2/2024 9:49 AM*
Good morning @Kelly, thank you for the update. Given the content will be ready by 8/6 and the 7th was noted as a potential launch date, I can aim to have the critical functionality ready by Wednesday with any additional content by Friday. Let me know if that's a good time frame for you.

**Kelly Yacono**
*12:02 PM*
Hey, @Trent Brew! That time frame sounds great! Thank you!

**Matthew**
*1:30 PM*
Awesome, thanks, both!

**Trent Brew**
*August 5th, 2:52pm*
Hey @Kelly Yacono, quick question: Are we using the MemberPress plugin to manage access for both the newroot.org website and the online portal web app, or is it only used for the website?

**Trent Brew**
*9:00 AM*
Good morning @Kelly Yacono, thank you for the update. Given the content will be ready by 8/6 and 8/7 has been noted as a potential launch date, I can aim to have the critical functionality ready by Wednesday with any additional content by Friday. Let me know if that's a good time frame for you.

**Kelly Yacono**

Hey, @Trent Brew! That time frame sounds great! Thank you!

**Matthew**

Awesome, thanks, both!

Good morning team @here, just a quick update: The Restorative Practice Toolkit page and membership rules have been added to the site and are currently live. The resource dropdowns are placeholders for now, but I can begin populating them with the content links whenever you are ready üëçüèΩ

**Kelly Yacono**
*10:58 AM*
Good morning, @Trent Brew! Thank you so much for your hard work on this! We are still finalizing the titles/content and will make sure to send that information as soon as we have confirmation. I do have a question for you, Trent and @Matthew. It's been brought to our attention that there is one resource that may need to have subfolders (we are still confirming this). If we were to have one folder with 6 subfolders would you have the bandwidth to add them and what would the timing look like? Also, would there be any cost implications we would need to consider? Thank you!

**Matthew**
*11:06 AM*
Hi @Kelly Yacono. Thanks for letting us know. No problem. No cost implications there, but I‚Äôll let @Trent Brew speak to timeline!

**Trent Brew**
*11:15 AM*
@Kelly Yacono No problem at all, the subfolder should be doable within the same timeframe. Let me know if there's anything else I can support with in the interim.
