    Hey Matthew, just sent an email invite for the Figma I was trying to share when my Zoom frooze. ([Figma Link](https://www.figma.com/file/glrPKJkv3986BDj7snkaBa/docket.tv?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=cbaxHf8A5LW6x4fY-1))
    Feel free to leave comments/questions throughout. I'll be working on the Manifesto this evening and will have that + a link to the prototype sent over this week

    Thanks so much, Trent. Will do. I‚Äôll try to dig into it tomorrow.

    Hey Matthew, just sent an email invite for the TV Guide CMS proposal ([Notion Link](https://www.notion.so/trentbrew/Docket-tv-Manifesto-b72d55e2b0214c399f194b13a7ce20bd)).
    It's pretty long and I'm working on a slide deck to summarize the key points but wanted to get your thoughts on the full proposal. Let me know if you have any questions or need more details. Looking forward to discussing this further with you!

- **Matthew**

  - **8:01 PM**
    I'm getting this response. I think it's an access issue.

- **Trent Brew**

  - **8:08 PM**
    Sorry about that, this link should work: [Notion Link](https://trentbrew.notion.site/Docket-tv-Project-Proposal-b72d55e2b0214c399f194b13a7ce20bd?pvs=4)

    I've also prepared some questions for Rebecca regarding the series timeslots and TV show data she provided. Do you think it would be best to ask for this information over email or wait until our next call to discuss?

- **Matthew**

  - **2:35 PM**
    Hey Trent! I have access to everything and am taking some time this afternoon to get through it all. So sorry for the delay. Had a busy couple of days wrapping up some stuff on a couple of additional projects.

- **Matthew**

  - **2:36 PM**
    I'm also passing along the feedback below for Bronzeville Blues. Do you think a call next week would be helpful to learn more, or does this provide some clarity for next steps?

- **Matthew**

  - **2:48 PM**
    @Trent Brew, this proposal is incredible. Excellent work. Let's isolate some time next week to discuss further. My main questions are:
  - Timeline
  - Team + Project Structure
    More to discuss. Let me know if you want to isolate some time for next week to discuss at depth. And let me know what 2-3 segments of the proposal you feel are best to share and present to Rebecca.

- **Matthew**

  - **5:37 PM**
    Revisted the designs as well. Love them all.

- **Matthew**

  - **11:29 AM**
    Hey @Trent Brew! I wanted to check in on the deck. Can you send whenever ready so I can provide some feedback prior to our chat with Rebecca today? Thanks!

- **Trent Brew**

  - **12:34 PM**
    This is the outline I'm using for the deck. I'm getting hung up on the layout and images etc so wanted to send the pure contents for now to make sure it's what we're wanting to communicate. I'll send the canva link in just a sec

- **Matthew**

  - **12:42 PM**
    Hey Trent - This is great All looks good, but I would remove the following bullet points. You can save them for future use, but let's remove them for sake of today's conversation:
  - Slide 7: Roadmap
  - Slide 8: Partnership Proposal
    Let's also add a Scope and Timeline slide that has a couple of bullet points noting how long you think this will take to build FOR Rebecca and SPEAK, as well as noting that we'll cotninue to chip away at design deliverables in tandem. Thanks!

    Hey Matthew, I've attached the Q&A notes from the remainder of our call with Rebecca.
    We discussed the next design deliverables as well. I'll be prioritizing the following:
  - Table cover/banner
  - Two pop-up banners

<!-- Trent over-does it and basically redesigns/rebuilds the whole site -->

    Hey Matthew, just wanted to give a quick update on the Speak website updates.
    While working on it this week I found myself going a bit overboard. This is what I've been working on: [Speak Website Prototype](https://speakmpls2.webflow.io)
    I understand that this is bordering on a full redesign which is not within scope but I do think this design solves many of the outstanding issues. I'd love to discuss on Monday if possible. Looking forward to your thoughts

    Hey Matthew,
    Just wanted to check in and share a quick update on my travel plans and our project deliverables.
    I'm in California helping my parents move. Later today, I'll be heading to St. Louis‚Äîa 26-hour drive. I might be a bit slow to respond for a couple of days, but I'll do my best to stay in touch. I'm okay with taking our call with Rebecca tomorrow while I'm on the road, but let me know what works for you.
  - Speak MPLS:
    - Embedded Instagram feed added to both the current site and the alternate design.
    - Custom CSS used to remove watermarks.
  - Elaine Wackerly:
    - Finalizing Brand v2.
  - Bronzeville Blues:
    - Progress on organizations diagram/design.
  - Docket.tv: - GitHub team account set up for Gumbo. - Slide deck tweaks made.
    I hope this stand-up-esque format is helpful. Let me know if you'd like me to continue sharing updates in this way or if you'd prefer a different approach. Thanks!

- **Matthew**
  - **5:04 PM**
    Thanks, Trent. I'll respond in full this eve. Safe driving!

<!-- Speak MPLS call with Rebecca is missed by Trent due to Travel. Trent wants to know whether Matthew met with Rebecca and whether he should be filled in on anything. Trent is settled in Chicago now and arrived from the 26hr drive this morning from California. -->

    Hey Matthew,

I hope you're doing well.

I've just settled in Chicago after arriving this afternoon. I'll be here until May 18th before heading to St. Louis for some home renovation work, then off to Anaheim to help my parents move everything out of storage, and finally back to Chicago for a longer stay. It's been hectic, but I'm looking forward to some stability soon. I'll keep you updated on my availability for calls and meetings.

I was hoping to check in to see if you met with Rebecca yesterday and if there's anything I should be filled in on? I'm available to chat now if you have time, or anytime tomorrow.

Also, there's no rush on reviewing the updates I sent over yesterday. Whenever you're ready, we can discuss them. I'll go ahead & proceed with the same template for Elaine v2 for now and will send that to you shortly üëçüèæ

I'll be amtrak/flying for these trips, so I'll be available as usual for calls and meetings, and I regret missing our call with Rebecca yesterday. I was hoping to check in to see if you met with her and if there's anything I should be filled in on? I'm available to chat now if you have time, or anytime tomorrow. Tuesdays at 2pm CT for Speak recurring still works for me. In the future, would it be best if I reach out to Rebecca directly regarding scheduling?

Were you and Rebecca able to meet yesterday? If so, is there anything I should be filled in on? I wasn't sure if it would be okay to share the updates without your input first but I'm available to chat now if you have time, or anytime tomorrow.

Also, there's no rush on reviewing the updates I sent over yesterday. Whenever you're ready, we can discuss them. I'll go ahead & proceed with the same template for Elaine v2 for now and will send that to you shortly.

Hey Matthew,

Just touched down in Chicago, staying until May 18th before heading to St. Louis and Anaheim, then back here for a longer period. Despite all the moving around, I'm available for calls and meetings as usual.

I apologize for missing our call with Rebecca yesterday. Have you caught up with her? I wasn't sure if it would be best to share the updates without your input first, but I'm available to discuss now if you have time or tomorrow. Let me know if there's anything urgent I need to know. No rush on the updates I sent; I'll continue with Elaine v2 using the previous deck and will have that sent over shortly.

No rush on the updates I sent over; It was a lot. In the meantime, I'll proceed with Elaine v2 based on the previous deck and will send that over shortly.
