Hi Trent,

I hope all is well as it can be for you and your family.

We wanted to let you know that the funds we applied for the website were awarded to us! If you're able to check-in later this week or sometime next week, we'd love to find a time to circle up and discuss next steps.

Thank you!

**Subject:** Re: Website Map Confirmation

Hi Trent,

I just wanted to double check - the website map. There's no need to make these changes right away other than the changes we previously discussed. I just want to make sure you aren't doing any work we haven't contracted you on. Happy to connect this week to make sure we're on the same page with everything :)

Best,

**Subject:** Website Map and Webflow Preview

Hey Ryan,
Thanks for sharing the website map! I appreciate the detailed outline from you and Rosa—it’ll definitely help guide our approach for the current and future versions of the site. I’ll get started on implementing these updates right away.
I’ve also put together an early preview of the Webflow build for you to check out: [NewRoot Prototype - Home | GOCLASS Webflow Template](https://newroot-prototype.webflow.io)

It’s still in the early stages but should be a helpful visual as we gather more content, copy, and assets.
Just a quick note that I’ll be out of town due to a family emergency for the next two weeks. I may not be available for a call until after Thanksgiving, but I’m still around to answer questions and help with anything you need in the meantime.

Thanks again,
Trent

**Subject:** Website Map Discussion

Hi Trent,

I hope you're doing well and your week is going smoothly.

I wanted to be sure to share this "website map" that Rosa and I drafted. We know we'll need to talk through a lot of this with you, so please feel free to let us know if there's a few good dates/times that would be helpful to check-in. We can sync up with Kelly and EK, too, if that's efficient and helpful for you!

Thank you,
Ryan
