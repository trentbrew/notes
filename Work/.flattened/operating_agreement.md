### 1. WORK AND PAYMENT

---

#### 1.1 Project

The Partners, Trenton Brew, Matthew Manning, and Rebecca Smith, are collaborating as co-founders and partners for the project scope of Docket.tv, a web app aiming to revolutionize the way broadcasters connect with their audience through a user-friendly, customizable TV Guide CMS.

#### 1.2 Roles and Responsibilities

- **Technical Director (Trenton Brew)**: UI/UX, front-end development, back-end development, systems architecture, devops, project management, technical support, and maintenance.
- **Co-Director of Operations (Matthew Manning)**: Business development, accounting, marketing, strategy, and project management.
- **Co-Director of Operations (Rebecca Smith)**: Community liaison, stakeholder engagement, project management, broadcasting industry liaison, and business development.

#### 1.3 Decision-Making

Decisions will be made by consensus among the Partners. In case of a deadlock, the Partners will seek mediation before moving to arbitration.

#### 1.4 Schedule

The work is ongoing for the duration of the project scope. This Agreement can be terminated by any Partner at any time, pursuant to the terms of Section 6, Term and Termination.

#### 1.5 Payment

The Partners will share profits evenly.

### Docket.tv Equity Scheme

| Role                      | Equity      |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| Technical Director        | 33.3%       |
| Co-Director of Operations | 33.3%       |
| Co-Director of Operations | 33.3%       |

The Partners agree that this adjustment reflects the critical role of the Technical Director in developing and maintaining the project’s technical infrastructure.

All profits will be disbursed according to this equity ratio. Payouts will occur at whichever timeframe is mutually agreed upon as convenient between the Partners:
- Within 3 Business Days upon receipt of any profits earned
- A cumulative disbursement at the end of each month
- A cumulative disbursement at the end of each quarter

In the event of the Partners being on-boarded onto a project scope that has a budget/payment schedule determined without considering the Partners' Payment, the Partners must do one of the following:
- Adjust the project scope's budget/payment schedule to include the Partners' quoted rate
- Accept and fulfill quoted invoices for work done by the Partners for the project scope

In the event of a dispute or early termination of the project, equity will only be distributed proportionally to the work completed, as mutually agreed upon by all parties or determined by an arbitrator if necessary.

#### 1.6 Expenses

The Partners agree to reimburse any tools or services deemed necessary by any Partner to continue their work without delaying the timeline, granted the Partners are notified no more than 3 business days post-acquisition of said tools or services. Any single expense exceeding $50 must be pre-approved in writing via email or letter by the Partners before incurring the cost. The Partners retain the right to reject reimbursement for any expense not pre-approved above this threshold.

#### 1.7 Invoices

The Partners will invoice based on the payment model delineated in Section 1.5 Payment. The Partners agree for their account to be automatically charged the amount owed unless another payment method is specified.

#### 1.8 Project Scope Support

The Partners will provide support for any deliverable within the mutually agreed upon project scope for Docket.tv over the course of the project's duration.

#### 1.9 Financial Reporting

The Partners will maintain transparent financial records and provide quarterly financial reports to each other. All project expenses must be approved by a majority of the Partners.

#### 1.10 Day-to-Day Conflict Resolution

For day-to-day disagreements that do not rise to the level of formal dispute resolution, the Partners agree to the following process:
- The Partners will first attempt to resolve the disagreement through direct communication and negotiation.
- If the disagreement persists, the Partners will schedule a meeting within 5 business days to discuss and resolve the issue.
- If the issue remains unresolved, the Partners will seek the advice of a mutually agreed-upon mediator to facilitate a resolution.

### 2. OWNERSHIP AND LICENSES

---

#### 2.1 Joint Ownership of Work Product

As part of this job, the Partners are creating a "work product" for the Project. To avoid confusion, "work product" is the finished product, as well as drafts, notes, materials, mockups, hardware, designs, inventions, patents, code, and anything else that the Partners work on—that is, conceive, create, design, develop, invent, work on, or reduce to practice—for a project scope. The Partners hereby jointly own this work product. This means the Partners share all rights, titles, and interests in and to the work product (including intellectual property rights). The Partners can use the work product however they want or they can decide not to use the work product at all. The Partners, for example, can modify, destroy, or sell it, as they see fit.

#### 2.2 Use of Work Product

Once the work product is created, the Partners do not have any rights to it except those that are explicitly agreed upon here. The Partners give permission to use the work product as part of portfolios and websites, in galleries, and in other media, so long as it is to showcase the work and not for any other purpose. The Partners do not give permission to sell or otherwise use the work product to make money or for any other commercial use. The Partners are not allowed to take back this license, even after the Agreement ends.

#### 2.3 Help Securing Ownership

In the future, the Partners may need each other's help to show that they jointly own the work product or to complete the transfer. The Partners agree to help with this process. For example, the Partners may have to sign a patent application. Any required expenses for this will be shared equally among the Partners. If a Partner can't be found after following a valid notice attempt as detailed in section 11.4 Notices, the other Partners can act on their behalf to accomplish the same thing. The following language gives the Partners that right: if a Partner can't be found after spending reasonable effort trying to do so (see section 11.4 Notices), the other Partners hereby irrevocably designate and appoint the missing Partner as their agent and attorney-in-fact, which appointment is coupled with an interest, to act for the missing Partner and on their behalf to execute, verify, and file the required documents and to take any other legal action to accomplish the purposes of paragraph 2.1 (Joint Ownership of Work Product).

#### 2.4 Partner's IP That Is Not Work Product

During the course of this project, the Partners might use intellectual property that they own or have licensed from a third party, but that does not qualify as "work product." This is called "background IP." Possible examples of background IP are pre-existing code, type fonts, properly-licensed stock photos, web application tools, and proprietary tools.

The Partners are not giving each other ownership of this background IP. However, as part of this Agreement, the Partners grant each other a non-exclusive, perpetual, and royalty-free license to use the background IP solely for the purposes of developing, marketing, selling, and supporting the Project's products and services.

This license is non-transferable, except as allowed under Section 11.1 Assignment, and does not include the right to resell or sublicense the background IP separately from the Project's products or services.

The Partners retain all rights to their background IP, and this license cannot be revoked, even after the Agreement is terminated.

#### 2.5 Right To Use Partner IP

The Partners may need to use each other's intellectual property to do their job. For example, if the Project requires building a website, the Partners may have to use each other's logos. The Partners agree to let each other use their intellectual property and other intellectual property that they control to the extent reasonably necessary to do the job. Beyond that, the Partners are not giving each other any intellectual property rights, unless specifically stated otherwise in this Agreement.

#### 2.6 IP Decisions

Decisions about filing patents or other IP protections will be made by consensus among the Partners. If a Partner leaves the project, their share of the IP will be bought out by the remaining Partners at a fair market value determined by an independent appraiser.

#### 2.7 IP Management upon Dissolution

If the partnership dissolves, the ownership of the IP will be handled as follows:
- The IP will be evaluated by an independent appraiser to determine its fair market value.
- The Partners will have the option to buy out each other's share of the IP at the appraised value.
- If no Partner wishes to buy out the others, the IP will be sold to a third party, and the proceeds will be distributed according to the equity scheme.
- Any ongoing projects will be completed or transferred to another entity as agreed upon by the Partners.

### 3. COMPETITIVE ENGAGEMENTS

---

The Partners are free to work for a competitor of the Project even within the state that the business is incorporated in after this Agreement ends. To avoid confusion, a competitor is any third party that plans to or actively develops, manufactures, promotes, sells, licenses, distributes, or provides products or services whose project scopes are substantially similar to the scope of the Project's products or services. If the Partners use employees or sub-project teams, the Partners must make sure they too follow the obligations in this paragraph, as well.

### 4. NON-SOLICITATION

---

Until this Agreement ends, the Partners won't:
- (a) encourage Project employees or service providers to stop working for the Project
- (b) encourage Project customers or clients to stop doing business with the Project
- (c) hire anyone who worked for the Project over the 12-month period before the Agreement ended.

The one exception is if the Partners put out a general ad and someone who happened to work for the Project responds. In that case, the Partners may hire that candidate. The Partners promise that they won't do anything in this paragraph on behalf of themselves or a third party.

### 5. REPRESENTATIONS

---

#### 5.1 Overview

This section contains important promises between the parties.

#### 5.2 Authority To Sign

Each Partner promises to the other Partners that they have the authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform all of their obligations under this Agreement.

#### 5.3 Right To Give Work Product

The Partners promise that they own all elements of the work product prior to its completion, that the Partners are able to give the work product to the Project, and that no other party will claim that they own the work product. If the Partners use employees or sub-project teams, the Partners also promise that these employees and sub-project teams have signed contracts with the Partners giving the Partners any rights that the employees or sub-project teams have related to the Partners' background IP and work product.

#### 5.4 Compliance With Laws

The Partners promise that the manner they do this job, its work product, and any background IP they use comply with applicable U.S. and foreign laws and regulations.

#### 5.5 Work Product Does Not Infringe

The Partners promise that their work product does not and will not infringe on someone else's intellectual property rights, that the Partners have the right to let the Project use the background IP, and that this Agreement does not and will not violate any contract that the Partners have entered into or will enter into with someone else.

#### 5.6 Review Work

The Partners promise to review the work product, to be reasonably available to each other if there are questions regarding this project, and to provide timely feedback and decisions.

#### 5.7 Supplied Material Does Not Infringe

If any Partner provides the Project with material to incorporate into the work product, that Partner promises that this material does not infringe on someone else's intellectual property rights.

### 6. TERM AND TERMINATION

---

#### 6.1 Termination

This Agreement is ongoing, until ended by any Partner. Any Partner may end this Agreement for any reason by sending an email or letter to all other Partners, formally notifying them that the sender is ending the Agreement. The Agreement will end after a 30-day notice period from the receipt of this email or letter unless otherwise agreed upon in writing.

#### 6.2 Ending Sections

The following sections don't end even after the Agreement ends:
- 2 (Ownership and Licenses)
- 3 (Competitive Engagements)
- 4 (Non-Solicitation)
- 5 (Representations)
- 8 (Confidential Information)
- 9 (Limitation of Liability)
- 10 (Indemnity)
- 11 (General).

#### 6.3 Exit Strategy

If a Partner wishes to leave, the remaining Partners have the option to buy out their share at a fair market value determined by an independent appraiser. If the partnership dissolves, the project and IP will be sold, and the proceeds will be distributed according to the equity scheme.

#### 6.4 Partner Incapacitation

If a Partner becomes incapacitated and is unable to fulfill their responsibilities, the following steps will be taken:
- The incapacitated Partner's responsibilities will be temporarily reassigned to the remaining Partners or a designated representative.
- The incapacitated Partner's equity and profit share will remain unchanged during the period of incapacitation.
- If the incapacitation extends beyond 6 months, the remaining Partners will have the option to buy out the incapacitated Partner's share at a fair market value determined by an independent appraiser.
- The incapacitated Partner or their legal representative will be consulted throughout this process to ensure fair treatment.

### 7. INDEPENDENT PARTNERS

---

The Partners are collaborating as independent entities. The following statements accurately reflect their relationship:
- The Partners will use their own equipment, tools, and material to do the work.
- No Partner will control how the job is performed on a day-to-day basis. Rather, each Partner is responsible for determining when, where, and how they will carry out the work.
- No Partner will provide the other Partners with any training.
- The Partners do not have an employer-employee relationship.
- The Partners cannot enter into contracts, make promises, or act on behalf of each other without mutual consent.
- Each Partner is responsible for their own taxes.
- No Partner will withhold social security and Medicare taxes or make payments for disability insurance, unemployment insurance, or workers compensation for the other Partners or any of their employees or sub-project teams.

### 8. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

---

#### 8.1 Overview

This Agreement imposes special restrictions on how the Partners must handle confidential information. These obligations are explained in this section.

#### 8.2 Confidential Information

While working on the Project, the Partners may come across, or be given, information that is confidential. This is information like customer lists, business strategies, research & development notes, statistics about a website, and other information that is private. The Partners promise to treat this information as if it is their own confidential information. The Partners may use this information to do their job under this Agreement, but not for anything else. For example, if one Partner lets another use a customer list to send out a newsletter, the Partner cannot use those email addresses for any other purpose. The one exception to this is if the Partners give each other written permission to use the information for another purpose, the Partners may use the information for that purpose, as well. When this Agreement ends, the Partners must give back or destroy all confidential information, and confirm that they have done so. The Partners promise that they will not share confidential information with a third party, unless the other Partners give written permission first. The Partners must continue to follow these obligations, even after the Agreement ends. The Partners' responsibilities only stop if they can show any of the following:
- (i) That the information was already public when the Partners came across it
- (ii) The information became public after the Partners came across it, but not because of anything the Partners did or didn't do
- (iii) The Partners already knew the information when they came across it and didn't have any obligation to keep it secret
- (iv) A third party provided the Partners with the information without requiring that they keep it a secret
- (v) The Partners created the information on their own, without using anything belonging to the other Partners.

#### 8.3 Third-Party Confidential Information

It's possible the Partners each have access to confidential information that belongs to third parties. The Partners each promise that they will not share with the other Partners confidential information that belongs to third parties, unless they are allowed to do so. If the Partners are allowed to share confidential information with each other and do so, the sharing Partner promises to tell the other Partners in writing of any special restrictions regarding that information.

#### 8.4 Confidentiality Period

The confidentiality obligations under this Agreement will continue for a period of 3 years after the Agreement ends.

#### 8.5 Extended Confidentiality for Trade Secrets

For certain types of confidential information, such as trade secrets, the confidentiality obligations under this Agreement will continue indefinitely, or until the information no longer qualifies as a trade secret under applicable law.

### 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

---

None of the Partners are liable for breach-of-contract damages that the breaching Partner could not reasonably have foreseen when they entered this Agreement. The maximum aggregate liability of any Partner under this Agreement, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, will not exceed the total fees and equity payable to the Partners for the project. None of the Partners will be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including lost profits or lost business opportunities, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. However, this limitation does not apply to any liability arising from gross negligence or willful misconduct.

### 10. INDEMNITY

---

#### 10.1 Overview

This section transfers certain risks between the Partners if a third party sues or goes after any of the Partners. In the event of a claim arising under this indemnification provision, the indemnified Partner must notify the indemnifying Partner promptly in writing of the claim, and the indemnifying Partner will have the right to assume and control the defense of the claim. The indemnified Partner agrees to provide reasonable cooperation in the defense. The indemnifying Partner will not settle any claim without the indemnified Partner's prior written consent unless the settlement fully releases the indemnified Partner from all liability.

#### 10.2 Indemnity

In this Agreement, each Partner agrees to indemnify the other Partners (and their affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents) from and against all liabilities, losses, damages, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) related to a third-party claim or proceeding arising out of:
- (i) The work the Partner has done under this Agreement
- (ii) A breach by the Partner of its obligations under this Agreement
- (iii) A breach by the Partner of the promises it is making in Section 5 (Representations)
- (iv) Any gross negligence or willful misconduct by the Partner.

### 11. GENERAL

---

#### 11.1 Assignment

This Agreement applies only to the Partners. The Partners cannot assign their rights or delegate their obligations under this Agreement to a third-party (other than by will or intestate), without first receiving the other Partners' written permission.

#### 11.2 Dispute Resolution

As the exclusive means of initiating adversarial proceedings to resolve any dispute arising under this Agreement, a Partner may demand that the dispute be resolved by mediation administered by a mutually agreed mediator. If mediation fails, the dispute will be resolved by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its commercial arbitration rules.

#### 11.3 Modification; Waiver

To change anything in this Agreement, the Partners must agree to that change in writing and sign a document showing their agreement. No Partner can waive its rights under this Agreement or release the other Partners from their obligations under this Agreement, unless the waiving Partner acknowledges it is doing so in writing and signs a document that says so.

#### 11.4 Notices

(a) Over the course of this Agreement, one Partner may need to send a notice to the other Partners. For the notice to be valid, it must be in writing and delivered in one of the following ways: personal delivery, email, or certified or registered mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested). The notice must be delivered to the Partner's address listed at the end of this Agreement or to another address that the Partner has provided in writing as an appropriate address to receive notice.

(b) The timing of when a notice is received can be very important. To avoid confusion, a valid notice is considered received as follows:
- (i) if delivered personally, it is considered received immediately;
- (ii) if delivered by email, it is considered received upon acknowledgement of receipt;
- (iii) if delivered by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested), it is considered received upon receipt as indicated by the date on the signed receipt.

If a Partner refuses to accept notice or if notice cannot be delivered because of a change in address for which no notice was given, then it is considered received when the notice is rejected or unable to be delivered. If the notice is received after 5:00pm on a business day at the location specified in the address for that Partner, or on a day that is not a business day, then the notice is considered received at 9:00am on the next business day.

#### 11.5 Severability

This section deals with what happens if a portion of the Agreement is found to be unenforceable. If that's the case, the unenforceable portion will be changed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, unless that change is not permitted by law, in which case the portion will be disregarded. If any portion of the Agreement is changed or disregarded because it is unenforceable, the rest of the Agreement is still enforceable.

#### 11.6 Signatures

The Partners can use any electronic tool or service they see fit for signing this document. These electronic signatures count as originals for all purposes.

#### 11.7 Governing Law

The laws of the state of that the business is incorporated in govern the rights and obligations of the Partners under this Agreement, without regard to conflict of law principles of that state.

#### 11.8 Entire Agreement

This Agreement represents the Partners' final and complete understanding of this job and the subject matter discussed in this Agreement. This Agreement supersedes all other agreements (both written and oral) between the Partners.

#### 11.9 Amendments

To change anything in this Agreement, the Partners must agree to that change in writing and sign a document showing their agreement.

#### 11.10 Force Majeure

Partners will not be held responsible for delays or failures in fulfilling their obligations under this Agreement if such delays or failures are due to circumstances beyond their reasonable control, such as natural disasters, war, terrorism, strikes, or government regulations.

#### 11.11 Insurance

Each Partner agrees to maintain appropriate insurance coverage for their activities under this Agreement, including general liability and professional liability insurance.

#### 11.12 Specific Performance

The Partners agree that any breach of the confidentiality or non-compete provisions of this Agreement would cause irreparable harm and that monetary damages would not be a sufficient remedy. Therefore, the Partners agree that the non-breaching Partners will be entitled to seek specific performance as a remedy for any such breach.

#### 11.13 Taxes

Each Partner is responsible for their own taxes arising from their share of the profits and equity under this Agreement. The Partners agree to cooperate in providing any necessary tax documentation to each other.

#### 11.14 Regular Partnership Reviews

The Partners agree to conduct regular reviews of the partnership at least once a year. During these reviews, the Partners will discuss the state of the business, evaluate the performance of each Partner, and consider any needed changes to the Agreement. Any amendments to the Agreement resulting from these reviews will be documented and signed by all Partners.
