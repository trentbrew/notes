<!--

context: I've been working on some graphic design for speakmpls (client: rebecca). They are for a tent canopy, table cover, t-shirt, etc. I'm finally done with the designs and am sending them over for her to review. It's taken a while so I want to thank her for her patience.

The designs are being delivered as a video, because there are 3d elements with multiple viewing angles.

I want her to let me know which of each design she would like to move forward with, and I will send those raw files her way.

Hi Rebecca,

I'm excited to share the final designs for the VistaPrint items. Thank you so much for your patience throughout the process.

The designs are attached as a video to showcase the 3D elements from multiple angles. Please review them and let me know which designs you'd like to move forward with. Once you've decided, I'll send over the raw files.

Have a great rest of the weekend!

- Trent
