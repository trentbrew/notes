# Draft for Matthew

Hey Matthew, just wanted to give a quick update on the Speak website updates.
While working on it this week I found myself going a bit overboard. This is what I've been working on: https://speakmpls2.webflow.io
I understand that this is bordering on a full redesign which is not within scope but I do think this design solves many of the outstanding issues (albeit, a rough prototype)
I'd love to discuss on Monday if possible. Looking forward to your thoughts
