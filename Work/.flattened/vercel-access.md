// context: she is an old lady. I'm trying to explain how this works in a way that wont confuse her more.

Hi Jasna,

I apologize for any confusion or miscommunication on my part. My understanding is that you would like to make edits to the site and that is why you're requesting access to Vercel. However, I want to clarify that Vercel is a platform for hosting and deploying websites, not for editing the content of the site itself. Think of Vercel as the land that a house is built on, and the codebase as the house itself. If you want to make changes to the site itself, you will need access to the codebase, which is stored on GitHub: https://github.com/trentbrew/podular

I've added you as a collaborator to the repository (the invite has been sent to `jasna@cafebellas.com`). Once you accept the invitation, changes can be made to the site by editing the code directly. Once a change is made, it is automatically deployed to the Vercel hosting platform and the changes will be reflected on the live site.

Last we spoke you mentioned your son might be able to help with this as it requires some knowledge of HTML. I'd be happy to walk you through the process if you need any help. I'm currently helping my parents move and will be on the road for the next few days, but I'd be open to schedule a call next week to go over this in more detail.

Please let me know if you've any issues accessing the codebase via GitHub, and I'll do my best to assist you.

Hi Jasna,

I hope you're well.

In order for me to transfer the Podular hosting to your Vercel account, you will need to Create a Team (vercel.com). Once your team account is set up, please let me know and I will transfer the project to you.

Best,

Hi Trent,
Thanks for getting back to me. I do need help working thru the process.
Let's set me up so I can do something too.
Yes, I need a new SOW for the service of additional website improvements, but not on a monthly basis yet.
Let's try to meet. I have Monday morning, Tuesday afternoon, or all day Wednesday available.
Let me know what works for you.

Hi Jasna,

Thank you for your continued patience.

The source code for the Podular website can be found here: trentbrew/podular (github.com)

I'd be happy to add you as a collaborator in the codebase if you'd like, as well as the hosting platform (vercel.com). This will allow you to grant access to any future developers to update the site. In this case we will need to set up a GitHub account for you. I'm available anytime this coming week to walk you through that process.

Alternatively, I'd be happy to make any changes/updates the site and continue to manage the infrastructure through my web design & development retainer package which can be found here: Trent Brew | Services
For as long as the monthly retainer is active, you'll have access to all of my web-based services including UI/UX, hosting & domain management, general maintenance, technical support, and any additional development at your request. I can begin the work right away following your subscription activation, elsewise I can send over a new SOW for your review and we can go from there.

Let me know if this works for you, and have a great rest of your weekend!

Best,

Hi Trent,
Can you add something about the restaurant tech to the website, or give me access so I can add something.
Thanks,
