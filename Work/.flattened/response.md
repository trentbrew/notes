  {
    original_text: "Do you do any UI/UX design stuff? I'm looking to hire a designer for a project I've been working on for several months but so far it's all just default Flutter/Material and it needs a UX review and facelift before releasing it.",
    email: "I made a Canva doc that has screenshots of what I built so far. I'd say I'm in the "late prototyping" stage. There's some descriptions in there and a link to a Google doc that has the original design written down. The main thing I need help with is making it look nice, and making sure I'm not introducing friction."
    followup_text: "Hey dude! It's Steven. Just sent you an email with some links that explain the project, so you can see if it's something that you'd be interested in. Feel free to leave comments on the doc or just text/email if you have any questions. After thanksgiving let's catch up regardless of what you wanna do w this thing, it's been so long!"

## Where do we go from here?

<!-- These are rough brain dump notes. The draft doesn't have to be in this order, or include all of these points. The draft should just be concise, clear, and Êüî -->

Trent(Me) has reviewed the app and has some notes and questions. He is drafting a response to Steven. In this draft Trent wants to communicate the following key points:

- I had a look at everything and it all makes sense and is super exciting.
- Most of my thoughts and questions are on paper so I have quite a few things that I'll be adding to the canva this week.
  I'm obsessed with Natalie's character design. Does the character have a name? I was looking into some options for the character animation and I have a few ideas but I'll be sure to drop those in the Canva before we sync.
- Is there a timeframe you have in mind for launch, or any important dates coming up I should be aware of?
- If you're still up for it I'm free next Friday to catch up.
- I would also be down to take a day trip up north to catch up over lunch sometime. I haven't been to SF since we last went and I've been meaning to re-visit and catch up.
- Let me know your thoughts and availability for the next steps.

## Goal of this draft

# Trent's Message (Sun)

Hey Stov üëãüèæ
Hope you and Natalie had a great thanksgiving

Thanks for your patience while I dug into everything! The app looks amazing, and I‚Äôm really excited about what you‚Äôve built so far. I‚Äôve got a bunch of thoughts and questions written down, so I‚Äôll be adding those to the Canva doc this week.

Also, I‚Äôm obsessed with Natalie‚Äôs character design‚Äîdoes she have a name? I‚Äôve been brainstorming some ideas for her animation and will include them in the Canva as well before we sync.

Do you have a timeline in mind for launch, or any big dates coming up that I should keep in mind? I‚Äôm free next Friday if you‚Äôre still down to catch up, or we could plan a quick day trip to SF to hang out and talk things through in person‚ÄîI‚Äôve been meaning to re-visit anyway.

Let me know your thoughts and what works best for you!

# Stov's Response (Sun)

Hey! I don't have a strict timeline, it's mostly a passion project. Right now I'm focused mostly on building out a lot of the integrations with other websites,apps and media.

I don't think this tiger has a name. I'm hoping we can think of some bilingual pun or something. Tiger is ËÄÅËôé (Lao Hu) or just Ëôé ÔºàHu)
Next Friday is great. Also me and Ramsey are in Anaheim right now but we leave this afternoon. I think we're close to Irvine. It would be kinda crazy if you were around to get some breakfast (I have a car rn). Not to talk about the app, just to see ya

# Trent's Response (Mon)

Damn, I went to sleep right after texting you and just woke up. I'm in Anaheim rn seeing my parents so that would've been perfect üòû i'll be heading back to chicago on the 18th

# Stov's Response (Mon)
