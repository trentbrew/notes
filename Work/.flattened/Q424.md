# Follow Up: NewRoot Website + Next Steps

Good morning Team,

Looking forward to getting started on this next phase!

I still have full backend access from my previous work, so I'm all set there. I’d like to ensure I’m clear on any immediate needs or priorities for the website.

If a kickoff call would help align on these items, I’m happy to schedule one. I have good availability tomorrow and the rest of the week. Let me know what works best, and I’ll get it on the calendar.

If there's anything I can do in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best,
Trent

Hey Austin,

Hope you had a restorative weekend. We are ready to move forward with signing the contract. Would you like to send it for signatures, or shall we upload to DocuSign?

Also, Trent, would it be helpful to set up an initial meeting to establish ongoing admin needs and make sure you're set up with full access?

Thanks,

EK

Hi team –

Sincere apologies for the delay. You’ll find the contract attached. I believe there were some issues with the digital signing last time, so feel free to do so in whichever way you prefer, and send it back.

Many thanks, and let me know if you have any questions! Best,

Thanks, team! I really appreciate your support. The little one isn’t here quite yet, but will be any day/week now. Just taking off a bit of time early to finish up getting our home and life ready for this new reality.

I’ll have that scope to you all within a couple of hours. Once sent, I’ll pass it over to Austin to complete and final communications, invoicing, etc.

Speak soon!

Hi Kelly and team –

Thanks for this info on next steps. I’m happy to hear the call went well and that there are some clear steps moving forward.

I can certainly help with getting an admin contract going for maintaining the back-end for the next couple of months until you’re ready to transition. I will try to get that over to you tomorrow. It’s another day slammed with call, so if I need until Monday, I will let you know.

I will also work on getting the specifics of the website details back to you so you can make an informed decision come November/December.

More soon!

Good Afternoon, Everyone!

Trent, thank you so much for taking the time to meet with EK and I this afternoon. We appreciate your thoughts, insight and recommendations! Matthew, to loop you in, Trent suggested two options for us as far as next steps for our website:

1. On a monthly basis, have someone with back end background experience to monitor the back end server logs as well as the Opalstack server logs. Ideally, there would be automation set up to help with this. Trent, feel free to fill in any information I missed. Matthew, could we explore what it would look like to have a monthly admin contract with Gumbo to do this monthly monitoring until we're ready to migrate our site to a new platform?

2. Migrate the site to a modern platform like Webflow or Framer:

To follow up on a previous thread, regarding the timeline for the migration, we are hoping to be able to move forward with the project in December 2024. We will know for sure in November 2024 and will be sure to let you know either way.
Does Gumbo have a website mapping template you could share with us? A proactive step we can take on our end is to begin mapping out an outline of the pages/design of the new site.
Ongoing Overhead Cost Analysis - Could you please share the future estimated ongoing costs post migration?
Will the apps we currently have in Wordpress be replaced or will we be able to let go of some when we migrate to the new platform?
Matthew, would we be able to have a monthly admin contract put together with Gumbo as an immediate next step before the migration? Feel free to let us know if you'd like to jump on a call next week to discuss.

Thank you so much!
