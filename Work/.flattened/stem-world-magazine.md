### Target Market

1. **_Startups:_** Turtle Labs specializes in building custom web, mobile, and mixed reality applications for startups. Startups often have unique technological requirements and a need for innovative software solutions to support their growth and establish a competitive advantage.
   - **_Size:_** The startup market is large and growing rapidly. According to [CB Insights](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/), 70% of startups fail within the first 20 months. The primary reasons for failure include lack of market need, lack of capital, and poor team dynamics. Turtle Labs aims to address these challenges by providing startups with affordable development & design services, strategic guidance, and the technical expertise they need to succeed.
   - **_Growth:_** The startup market is growing rapidly. According to [CB Insights](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/), the number of startups has increased by 50% since 2011. The startup market is expected to continue growing at a rate of 10% per year over the next decade. However, only a small fraction of the total $215.9 billion in U.S. venture capital allocated in Q4 2022 was allocated to traditionally under-represented founders. According to [Tech Crunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/06/black-founders-still-raised-just-1-of-all-vc-funds-in-2022/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmluZy5jb20v&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAClkIVcpxodpQHebLUfqo0OwzvI2VcqYnvf6ymQi1SdeB8WTV1JJAuinw7rV7TzmFmvaSy_Blx2luyQBdHt4sxL7IUMVdAzdwRVYE1vaQwdub5LiKDVArXQkUAE_0ysBzFubzaTltde7tEJu0Gk5NcYM2War68B9PSXFJd5B9UDx) and [BOSTINNO](https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/inno/stories/news/2022/07/22/black-latinx-startups-funding-h12022.html), only 0.79% of the total VC funding from Q4 2022 went to black founders, and in Massachusetts alone only 1% of funding was raised by Latinx founders. This is why we feel it's important to make our services affordable and accessible, so that we can help our clients grow their businesses and establish a competitive advantage.

   - **_Growth:_** Small businesses are ripe for innovation, as they are often more agile and flexible than larger companies, which can make it easier for them to adapt to new technologies and trends.
