# Work Plan

## Scope of Services

As mentioned in the Project Understanding section of this proposal, SPEAK MPLS is uniquely positioned to continue providing the following core public access TV services to fulfill the responsibility of supporting community voices, as identified in the City’s RFP 2024-38:

Our work plan takes an innovative approach to achieve the five stated goals through a multimedia strategy to deliver the core public access TV services—channel programming management, media services, and content distribution—within the allocated budget. At the same time, we recognize that some of the City’s broader goals for reimagining public access TV as an inclusive CMC extends beyond the traditional public access TV services, aiming for a dynamic and forward-thinking approach that positions Minneapolis as a model of national success with great impact on Minneapolis residents.

While some goals naturally align with the three (3) core services, including ensuring that underrepresented communities, with a focus on accessible and multilingual content, and are prioritized, the full scope of the City’s ambitions requires an expanded approach. Meeting the additional expectations in areas such as community engagement, advanced training, and accessibility features such as captioning will require increased support in the form of technical assistance, new equipment and additional funding. These resources are critical for keeping the pace, not only with the national standard for other urban public access TV stations, but in sustaining the growth needed to meet the City’s evolving vision for community media.

## Goals

The City has identified five (5) goals under the Scope of Services to holistically frame the work and expectations for this project. Our proposed work plan focuses on each of these goals:

- **Goal One:** Empower Inclusive Content Creation
- **Goal Two:** Foster Vibrant Community Dialogue
- **Goal Three:** Cultivate a Diverse and Engaging Content Library
- **Goal Four:** Fostering Collaborative Relationships
- **Goal Five:** Cultivating a Pathway to Media Careers

To meet the City’s stated goals, SPEAK MPLS presents our four key service pillars: CREATE, AMPLIFY, ENGAGE, and TEACH, representing the foundation of our current work. We are excited to continue providing inclusive media resources, fostering vibrant dialogue and collaborative relationships, and cultivating a pathway to media careers. Through our pillars, we will ensure that every resident has the tools, training, and platforms necessary to create, share, and access media on SPEAK MPLS TV that reflects the unique diversity of Minneapolis.

### Goal One: Empower Inclusive Content Creation

The rise of digital media requires an inclusive approach to ensure all residents of Minneapolis have the opportunity to produce and access media tools and specialized support. SPEAK MPLS is committed to ensuring that content creation is accessible to everyone through our CREATE MPLS service pillar, no matter their ability, particularly those from underrepresented groups.

CREATE MPLS encompasses our membership-activated community media resources, including access to professional equipment, studios with edit suites, and media consultations. According to the Asset Map created by the Jerome Foundation’s BIPOC filmmaker cohort, including our CEO Rebecca Smith, the data shows that there are real gaps in resources and barriers to finding affordable studio spaces, equipment, and production support and training. Big media gatekeepers, expensive equipment, and studio spaces can make the dream of creating content or films almost impossible for some. We are breaking down those barriers to equip underestimated communities with access to the media resources, tools, and platforms they need to be heard in ways that are accessible to all.

We currently have 152 members who access our resources, that would otherwise be unattainable to many creatives, storytellers, and organizations. In 2020, we developed a comprehensive Member Playbook to guide new, existing, and potential members through policies and procedures, maximizing their engagement and success within the SPEAK MPLS community.

**Enter Exhibit and description here**

Our members enjoy access to two studio locations in Minneapolis, both equipped with state-of-the-art media tools:

- **SPEAK MPLS Northeast Studio** features an ADA accessible 30x40 production space with 14’ high ceilings, three HD cameras, live streaming capabilities, floor Aputure lighting, an audio snake for microphones, and a kitchenette. The space also has two edit suites featuring iMacs with quiet keyboards, Adobe Creative Cloud Suite, iMovie, and Final Cut Pro.
- **SPEAK MPLS South Studio** offers an ADA accessible classroom with two edit suites and a podcast studio, featuring three PTZ robotic cameras, Aputure lighting (controllable via app), audio equipment including podcast microphones, and VMix recording and streaming software.

Our equipment library includes video cameras, audio gear, grip and lighting equipment, tripods, gimbals, and accessories, all of which are in high demand. In 2023 alone, members booked 511 hours of studio time, over 372 hours in the edit suites, and utilized over 46,000 hours of equipment bookings. We recently purchased production carts for check-out making carrying heavy equipment easier.

SPEAK MPLS implements a quarterly review process to evaluate the effectiveness of these community media resources, ensuring that key performance indicators are met. Results are submitted in a detailed progress report to the City.

#### Collaboration with Local Ethnic Media Organizations, Cultural Centers, and Language Justice Groups

SPEAK MPLS currently airs programs in multiple languages, and we will build on our existing partnerships with local ethnic media outlets and cultural organizations to expand multilingual content. Through our partnership with Strong Mind Strong Body Foundation, we are developing our core Media Literacy class in Spanish, with more classes in the works. We will also develop new partnerships with language justice groups to ensure that we have the support and capacity needed to offer our media services in other languages when requested in ASL, Spanish, Somali, Hmong and others.

#### Training Materials and Support Services in Multiple Languages

We have a plan to have all SPEAK MPLS materials translated into the languages most commonly spoken in Minneapolis in 2025, supported by funding from Press Forward. We will engage with partners to ensure we have access to multilingual trainers to provide hands-on assistance to non-English speakers upon request, ensuring full participation in our media programs.

#### Resources and Training for Accessible Content Formats

SPEAK MPLS currently has ADA-complaint printed materials and will need technical support and additional resources from the City of Minneapolis to help us implement accessible technology such as closed captioning on SPEAK MPLS TV, assistive listening devices, and user-friendly media platforms compatible with screen readers and other assistive technologies.

#### Utilizing Multiple Digital Platforms to Share Content

In addition to broadcasting on the three (3) Minneapolis public access TV channels, we publish our original content series via YouTube and will be exploring the cost of publishing our channels on over-the-top (OTT) media platforms like Apple TV and Roku. After exploring the cost of a content delivery service for video streaming online, our conclusion that the more than $20,000 in start-up costs was not within the scope of the city's allocated budget. With the help of our Network Administrator and Technical Engineer (NATE), we were able to build own, independently powered 24/7 webstream on our website, reaching a global audience.

SPEAK MPLS is developing an innovative web platform that will transform how broadcasters and viewers interact with live content. This user-friendly, customizable TV Guide platform will bridge the gap between producers and their audiences, fostering a more connected and engaging media landscape. The platform will enhance operational efficiency, promote inclusivity, and provide valuable insights through advanced analytics. Features like closed captioning, audio descriptions, and text-to-speech options will ensure content is accessible to all viewers, including those with disabilities. The platform's scalable architecture and AI-driven analytics will empower SPEAK MPLS to continuously improve its offerings based on viewer engagement data, helping us exceed national standards for urban public access TV stations.

#### Dedicated Co-Working Spaces with Accessible Technology

SPEAK MPLS will continue to offer accessible co-working spaces within our two (2) studios, equipped with the latest multimedia technology and software. These spaces provide a collaborative environment for content creation, with in-demand features like a podcast studios. In 2023, our members booked 511 hours of studio time and over 372 hours of edit suite use.

#### Commitment to ADA Title II Compliance

As part of our commitment to inclusion, SPEAK MPLS will ensure that all facilities and services meet ADA Title II requirements. Our Member Playbook includes a formal statement reaffirming this commitment, and we regularly audit our facilities and programming to ensure accessibility. Additionally, our website conforms to WCAG 2.1 A and AA standards.

Through the CREATE MPLS pillar, we are making strides to democratize media creation, providing the resources and tools necessary for all Minneapolis residents to create their stories.

### Goal Two: Foster Vibrant Community Dialogue

Public access thrives on community participation and dialogue. SPEAK MPLS will foster environments for robust discussions that reflect the diversity of perspectives within Minneapolis.

#### Interactive Workshops on Storytelling, Content Creation, and Media Literacy

We will host bi-monthly workshops on various aspects of media production, including storytelling techniques, video editing, and citizen journalism. These workshops will encourage peer-to-peer learning and collaboration between participants.

#### Online Forums and Social Media Groups for Ongoing Discussions

SPEAK MPLS will create and manage online forums and social media groups where Minneapolis residents can continue discussions initiated on the public access channels. These platforms will encourage interaction and allow residents to share their thoughts on community issues in real time.

#### Community Events to Encourage Participation

We will host quarterly events, such as panel discussions and screenings, to bring community members together in person and foster connections through media. These events will focus on relevant local issues and encourage residents to become more active in media creation.

#### Collaborative Content Creation Projects

SPEAK MPLS will launch community-wide content creation projects where residents from different neighborhoods and cultural backgrounds collaborate on media productions. These projects will reflect the shared experiences of Minneapolis residents and encourage cross-community dialogue.

#### Culturally Specific Outreach Strategies

We will implement outreach strategies tailored to various cultural communities within Minneapolis, ensuring they are represented in our programming. This will include direct engagement with cultural leaders and organizations to encourage participation in public access programs.

#### Comprehensive Community Needs Assessment

To better understand the needs of different Minneapolis communities, SPEAK MPLS will conduct a needs assessment through surveys and focus groups. The findings will guide our programming and outreach strategies.

#### Engagement with Diverse Stakeholders

We will actively engage with community organizations, resident groups, and local schools to understand their aspirations for public access TV. These stakeholders will play a role in shaping our programming and ensuring it remains relevant to community needs.

#### Content Curation Reflecting Minneapolis' Diverse Perspectives

SPEAK MPLS will curate programming that showcases the full range of experiences and perspectives from the Minneapolis community. We will prioritize content that fosters understanding and connection across diverse cultural and generational lines.

### Goal Three: Cultivate a Diverse and Engaging Content Library

Public access television thrives on the voices of its community. As recognized in the City's resolution to celebrate October 20th, 2024 as Community Media Day, public access TV has played a crucial role in amplifying voices from all backgrounds, fostering civic engagement, and ensuring vibrant freedom of expression. Through SPEAK MPLS, we will continue this legacy by supporting producers from diverse ethnicities, ages, genders, abilities, and perspectives with a platform to author their own stories, uncensored and in any language. Community media serves as an essential part of our democracy, creating a forum for meaningful dialogue and fostering transparency and civic participation.

A rich content library is essential for fostering public engagement and ensuring the long-term sustainability of public access TV. Through our AMPLIFY MPLS service pillar, we will ensure that diverse media content is promoted and distributed across SPEAK MPLS TV and our streaming platform, reaching a broad audience and sparking conversations that reflect the evolving identity and unique stories of Minneapolis.

In 2023, content was submitted by 84 unique members, totaling 1,779 first-run programs and 1,571 hours of programming—an impressive 20% increase in first-run programs compared to 2022. Additionally, we aired a total of 84,742 programs, representing 15,699 hours of content, a 21% increase from 2022.

#### Prioritizing Content that Reflects the Racial and Ethnic Diversity of Minneapolis

SPEAK MPLS will continue to prioritize content from underrepresented communities to ensure that the racial and ethnic diversity of Minneapolis is reflected across our programming. We have engaged with diverse groups in our member recruitment efforts, and as of June 2024, 71% of our members identifying with a diverse racial group.

We are also interested in a broad definition of diversity, to be inclusive of producers from all backgrounds—a cross-section of ethnicities, ages, genders, sexual orientations, abilities, philosophies, political affiliations, faiths, and more. Below is a more detailed breakdown of diversity of our membership:

- **Residency:** 75% of members are Minneapolis residents and 25% are non-residents
- **Age:** 29% are under 18, 12% are 18-34, 32% are 35-54, and 27% are over 55
- **Race/Ethnicity:** 71% are BIPOC, 28% are White, and 1% are unspecified.

Our expanded definition of diversity also includes diversity across content that we air, including multilingual programs (Spanish, Somali, Hmong, ASL), and diversity of topics such as knowledge (interviews, public affairs, education), arts and entertainment (culture, music, art, sports), and mind/body/spirit (religion, health, wellness) programming. Below is a breakdown of the type of diverse content aired on each channel and corresponding themes:

**Insert Exhibit number and description**

#### Supporting a Variety of Content Formats

Our content library includes documentaries, educational programming, artistic content, youth media projects, community discussions and panels. We also curate content through our SPEAK MPLS Presents series, where we select and present shows to reflect viewer interests and community priorities. In 2023, we curated and presented 269 unique programs featuring news, sporting events, church services, and other content created by PEG stations or available in the public domain. These shows were requested by, or of interest to, our viewers and members. The diverse lineup on SPEAK MPLS TV includes:

- **Sports Sundays**
- **High School Sports**
- **Women’s Sports Wednesdays**
- **SPEAK MPLS Sports** (featuring the St. Paul Saints and MN Vixen)
- **SPEAK Cinema**
- **Cartoon Classics**
- **SPEAK MPLS Live Music**
- **Music Video Showcase**
- **Spiritual Cinema Treasures**
- **WORSHIP MPLS**

#### Encouraging Audience Engagement

Content creators are encouraged to incorporate interactive features, like live Q&A sessions, where possible to foster direct engagement with their audience. (Note: SPEAK MPLS adheres to public access TV guidelines and does not allow calls-to-action in TV programming such as “go here” especially if it is commercial in nature, such as “buy this.”)

#### Transparent Curation Process

SPEAK MPLS maintains a transparent process for curating content, ensuring that shows we program as a part of the SPEAK MPLS Presents series align with community interests and adheres to public access guidelines. We regularly track viewership metrics on our webstream and member engagement to ensure that our programming remains relevant and impactful. We do not curate member content, which is uncensored, and adheres to our free speech approach stated below.

#### Measuring Success Through Metrics

To measure success, we can track metrics in real-time- viewership numbers, membership demographics, equipment usage, and audience engagement (e.g., likes, comments, shares) across platforms. As a team, we set our annual SPEAK MPLS goals and KPI targets in Q1 of every year at our annual team retreat. Quarterly and annual reports will be provided to the City for review, demonstrating our commitment to accountability and continued growth.

#### Minneapolis PSA Breaks and Collaborative Content Creation

Our PSA Break series provides dozens of Minneapolis organizations, including departments within the City of Minneapolis with a platform to share vital news and information, airing during our scheduled PSA Breaks on all three SPEAK MPLS channels. Additionally, collaborative content creation projects will be supported, where community members can work together to produce stories that reflect shared experiences, fostering cross-cultural understanding.

In 2023, we aired over 50 episodes of our AMPLIFY MPLS original content series, featuring community conversations, news, and local stories through programs like:

- **ELECT MPLS**
- **RYSE MPLS All-Stars**
- **DREAM MPLS**
- **LOVE MPLS**

#### Digital Media Content

In addition to TV programming, SPEAK MPLS leverages social media to engage audiences on multiple platforms. In 2023, we reached over 186,000 impressions across Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, providing an interactive and digital complement to our broadcast media. Our new website garnered over 21,000 views, further expanding the reach of our community-created content. These platforms enable us to foster vibrant conversations and direct interaction between content creators and viewers.

#### Prioritizing Minneapolis Residents and Non-Residents

SPEAK MPLS has a clear policy in the Member Playbook that defines the priority for Minneapolis residents as follows: While all members are important to SPEAK MPLS, we give the highest priority for channel access and community media services to Minneapolis residents, on a first-come, first-served basis. If a conflict occurs, SPEAK MPLS will apply priority in the following order:

- Minneapolis resident
- Organizations with their principal place of business in Minneapolis
- Twin Cities resident
- Organizations with their principal place of business in the Twin Cities
- Minnesota resident
- Organizations with their principal place of business in Minnesota
- Members outside of Minnesota
- Non-members

#### Commitment to Free Speech and First Amendment Rights

In alignment with the tradition of public access television, SPEAK MPLS is committed to upholding First Amendment rights by offering a censorship-free platform. While we maintain oversight through key metrics and equal opportunity policies set forth in our Member Playbook, we do not exercise prior restraint on member-submitted content.

Through the AMPLIFY MPLS pillar, we continue to play a vital role in promoting local stories, fostering vibrant community dialogue, and ensuring that Minneapolis' rich diversity is reflected in our programming.

### Goal Four: Fostering Collaborative Relationships

Strong relationships between community members, storytellers, and media professionals are the cornerstone of a thriving public access ecosystem. At SPEAK MPLS, our collaborations are rooted in trust, shared purpose, and a commitment to community empowerment. Over the years, our partnerships have allowed us to expand the reach of public access media and foster vibrant community dialogue, creativity, and storytelling across diverse populations. Through our ENGAGE MPLS service pillar, we will continue to cultivate these relationships, ensuring that community voices are amplified and supported by a dynamic network of collaborators.

ENGAGE MPLS is our service pillar encompassing member and community engagement, interactive events, partnerships, and sponsorships. We create opportunities for meaningful connections, providing a space for people to collaborate with one another through shared media experiences.

#### Developing an Online Directory of Community Storytellers and Media Professionals

Our online member portal currently serves as an online directory that connects local storytellers, content creators, and media professionals who are part of the SPEAK MPLS network. Members are able to interact, and the platform supports collaboration through postings for upcoming projects, sparking community-driven media initiatives. In addition, we serve as a resource for members looking to connect with media industry peers, professionals, and services in the Twin Cities area.

#### Creating a Resource Library for Media Production and Funding Opportunities

Through SPEAK MPLS Academy and our monthly newsletters, we offer a comprehensive resource library that provides information on media production resources, funding opportunities, and best practices for content creation. These resources are also made available across our social media platforms.

#### Supporting Collaborative Storytelling Projects

SPEAK MPLS supports members in collaborative media projects that reflect shared identities and experiences. In 2022, SPEAK MPLS launched RYSE MPLS, a program that brings teens together to create media about topics they care about. We plan to launch additional cohort programs for both adults and youth, as described in further detail in the Goal 5 section.

#### Organizing Networking Events

ENGAGE MPLS is central to how we organize networking events. We currently provide opportunities for networking through our Member Media Meetup (MMM) series, where we facilitate connections and collaborations among our members and community media professionals. Additionally, in 2023, we hosted our annual Member Meeting and Member Appreciation Party to engage members in the strategic planning process and celebrate our annual success together. On October 26, 2024, we will be hosting an epic 40th Anniversary Party celebration to honor past and present members and reflect on the future of media together- in costume! These events allow community members, content creators, and media professionals to connect, fostering new partnerships and media initiatives.

#### Establishing Mentorship Programs

SPEAK MPLS has mentorship built into every service pillar, and is woven into all SPEAK MPLS classes and workshops. Our classes are taught by experienced media professionals with emerging community storytellers. These programs will offer guidance, support, and skills development, helping new storytellers find their voice while strengthening the media ecosystem.

#### Accessibility Integrations Across the Organization

SPEAK MPLS is committed to accessibility across all of our programs and initiatives. We will offer accessibility training workshops to ensure information sharing is inclusive and caters to residents with diverse needs. These workshops will focus on integrating accessible content formats and user-friendly technologies, ensuring that all residents can participate fully in media production and collaboration.

#### Community Engagement and Participatory Storytelling Techniques

Through ENGAGE MPLS, our approach to engaging the community involves meeting people where they are. In 2023, we hosted and participated in 10 unique and exciting events, reaching over 800 new participants, and targeting traditionally underserved communities. Our staff and community instructors, including local and national filmmakers and media professionals, teach classes and workshops focused on community engagement and participatory storytelling techniques. These workshops help community members learn how to tell their stories in ways that reflect their experiences and engage their audience.

#### Member Engagement

In 2023, we engaged members across 223 media consultations, providing additional studio, equipment, and editing support. Each month, we profile our members in the SPEAK MPLS TV Producer Spotlight series, featured in our newsletter, on social media, and on our channels.

#### Community Engagement

We maintain strong community engagement through our presence at local events, publishing a monthly newsletter with over 1,300 subscribers, and creating original content in collaboration with community organizations about issues important to the community.

#### Partnerships and Sponsorships

In 2023, we engaged with 24 community partners—10 ongoing community partners, 2 paid production partners, and 2 media sponsorships. Our partnerships have strengthened the community’s ability to tell their stories, and we will continue to foster these relationships to build capacity. Additionally, we sponsored two annual events in 2023, including NEMAA’s 28th annual Art-A-Whirl and Twin Cities Pride, amplifying SPEAK MPLS to a broader audience and fostering collaborative relationships across the city.

### Goal Five: Cultivating a Pathway to Media Careers

Public access media serves as a gateway for residents to enter the media industry, particularly those from underrepresented communities. I need to add context here about how volunteering and public access TV curriculum are within the scope of the core public access TV services, but then workforce development, expanded career opportunities and professional development would be implemented as a part of our pilot project.

#### Volunteer Recruitment and Retention

SPEAK MPLS will launch a volunteer recruitment campaign aimed at attracting diverse individuals interested in media production. We will create a welcoming and inclusive environment that fosters long-term participation.

#### Responsive Public Access TV Training Curriculum

We will conduct skills assessments for members and non-members and offer tailored training programs based on individual strengths and interests. This includes workshops on storytelling, videography, editing, production management, publicity workshops, and social media content creation.

#### Media Workforce Development

I need to write a section here about our plans for workforce development. Could you draft an example?

#### Career Opportunities

SPEAK MPLS will highlight the work of volunteers on our public access channels and through partnerships with local media outlets. We will provide internship and job placement opportunities for volunteers interested in pursuing media careers.

#### Professional Development

Participants in the will have access to ongoing training and opportunities to work on real-world projects. This hands-on experience will equip them with the skills needed for media careers.

## Work Plan Schedule

Our team’s work plan schedule is divided into five phases of work, to commence in 2025, with a contract ending in 2029:

### Strategic Planning

SPEAK MPLS has strategically diversified its funding sources to ensure sustainability and mitigate risk. While the City contract will provide a significant portion of our funding, we have established and grown multiple revenue streams since 2020 and will continue to expand these to reduce dependence on any single source. Our financial strategy includes leveraging existing revenue growth, securing new grants, and cultivating production partnership opportunities.

#### Current Funding Sources

SPEAK MPLS' revenue streams include membership fees, education programs, partnership production services, and grants. Since we launched in 2020, we have generated over $400,000 in earned revenue, an average of 20% of our operating budget, which is above average for PEG stations across the nation, according to the Alliance for Community Media’s Salary Survey data. In 2024, we have generated $124,477.13 in revenue to date, accounting for 21% of our operating budget, with a 32% increase from 2023. The current breakdown is as follows including the contribution of each funding source to the overall budget:

- **SPEAK MPLS Membership:** Generated $17,910.05 (33%)
- **TEACH MPLS (Education):** Revenue totaled $1,600, reflecting a 17% decrease from 2022, which was offset by increased partnership revenue.
- **SPEAK MPLS STUDIOS (Partnership- Productions):** Through SPEAK MPLS STUDIOS, we generated over $100,000 in revenue, a 57% increase from 2023, with major contracts including Minneapolis Public Schools (MPS) and Hennepin Healthcare.
- **Grants:** SPEAK MPLS was selected in October 2024 through a highly competitive national process to receive Press Forward's Closing Local Coverage Gaps grant for $100,000, to be distributed across the next two years.

#### Revenue Growth Opportunities

- Something here about growth of memberships, studio rentals, etc to bring in additional revenue
- A significant opportunity for revenue growth is to expand our TEACH MPLS educational offerings (in-studio and through community pop-up workshops), paid consultations, and launch new SPEAK MPLS Academy paid on-demand class offerings. By increasing the number of in-person and online courses available, we anticipate significant growth in education revenue over the next three-to-five years.
- Our current capacity for SPEAK MPLS STUDIOS is to take on one major production services project per quarter. With additional support from the city enterprise, we could expand our capacity to provide more productions services, and connect the crew opportunities strategically to a workforce development pilot program.
- Our strategic sponsorship program SPONSOR MPLS will explore sponsorship opportunities available for individuals, organizations and businesses to show support for our programs, events, and original content, an area we have launched but not fully leveraged but which presents substantial potential.

#### Funding Mix

With our current and potential revenue streams and future grants, we will continue to leverage a mix of income sources. Currently, the City contract represents approximately 79% of our budget. Our goal is to reduce this percentage by increasing our earned revenue share.

#### Long-Term Revenue Goals

We aim for non-City funded assets (NCFA) to account for 35% of our total budget by 2026, with targeted growth in grants, partnerships, SPEAK MPLS Academy, and sponsorships.

#### Grant Strategy

We will target at least four grant applications in the first year of the contract to secure additional funding, including national and local grants focused on arts, media, media preservation, digital equity, broadband access, youth development and workforce development. For example, we plan to apply for the following grants in upcoming years:

- Jerome Foundation's Arts Organization Grant Program, seeking $65,000 for 2027-2028 to support Minnesota-based early career documentary filmmakers.
- MSAB
- MRAC
- MN Historical Society
- The Knight Foundation
- National Endowment for the Arts
- McKnight Foundation

#### Value of Assets

SPEAK MPLS currently manages all equipment listed in Attachment C and acknowledges the importance of maintaining and utilizing the City-owned equipment effectively to ensure continued high-quality media production for the Minneapolis community. The following steps outline our plan to manage the assets provided by the City:

#### Equipment Ownership and Maintenance

SPEAK MPLS will manage and maintain all City-owned audio, video, and editing equipment provided for the public access services. Our team will ensure that all equipment is kept in optimal working condition, including regular inspections, cleaning, and minor repairs. In the event of significant maintenance needs, we will notify the City promptly to ensure timely resolutions.

#### Inventory Management

We will maintain an up-to-date inventory of all City-owned equipment, including cameras, computers, editing software, and production tools. Our inventory management system will track usage, ensuring that equipment is available and accessible to all residents.

#### Technology Upgrades and Asset Management

As technology advances, SPEAK MPLS will proactively recommend updates and upgrades to the City’s equipment to keep pace with industry standards. Our strategy will include regular evaluations of equipment and software to identify opportunities for improvement. For instance, we plan to upgrade broadcast cameras and editing suites in year one of the contract.

#### Public Access and Accountability

We will make the City-owned equipment accessible to all Minneapolis residents through a transparent equipment checkout system. Residents will have the opportunity to reserve equipment for content creation projects. All equipment usage will be tracked and documented to ensure accountability and prevent misuse.

#### End-of-Contract Plan

At the conclusion of the contract, all City-owned equipment will be returned to the City in good working order. SPEAK MPLS will ensure that all assets are accounted for and properly documented in a final equipment report.
