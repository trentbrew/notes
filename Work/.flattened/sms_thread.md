# Black Mythology Project Thread

## Slack Message from Matthew to Trent

Hey! I have a project (outside of Gumbo) that you might be interested in. They're looking for a designer and I think you could be great. Mostly document design. Let me know if you're interested in learning more and being connected to the guy. Nothing binding, of course. It'd be entirely up to you (again, outside of Gumbo) whether or not you'd want to proceed.

### Notes from Matthew:
- **Original Email:** Hi! I‚Äôm looking for a Black graphic designer (or team) for a multi-media magazine I‚Äôm creating called the Black Mythology Project. The Black Mythology Project highlights the narratives that Black people in America have relied upon for meaning and creates a space where those narratives can be questioned. With a maximalist style that draws inspiration from comic book culture and Black nerddom, this magazine uses a variety of art forms to imagine a world where we would not have to be "superheroes" to matter. The project is centered on an essay I wrote and visual/performance art from artists based out of NYC, Chicago, and Nashville and I'm grateful to pay homage to the cities in which I've lived. I‚Äôve attached a pitch deck that I hope this will show the tone, vision, and some of the artwork for this project.
- **Discovery Notes:**
  - Looking for Black designers with connections to Chicago.
  - Collaborating with artists from Chicago, Nashville, and New York.
  - Project initiated back in school, writing started between 2021-2022.
  - Themes: Disconnect in the Black diaspora, identity, connection, fantasy.
  - 34-page foundational essay.
  - Art forms: short films, visual arts.
  - 37 artists contributing 50-55 pieces.
  - Design freedom encouraged.
  - Target completion: Early October.
  - Budget: Initially $1,000, potentially up to $1,500.

### Timestamps:
- **7:05 PM:** His budget is $1K, but I definitely think you could get him up to $1,500 based on our convo. Lemme know.
- **7:09 PM:** And to be clear, I wouldn't be a part of it. So it'd be your project to take on, if you want it.

## Email from Matthew to Stephen and Trent

Hi Stephen,

Thanks again for your time yesterday. It was a pleasure getting to learn more about your work, and I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing how the magazine takes shape.

I am connecting you here to Trent Brew, Gumbo‚Äôs lead designer, who has expressed interest in learning more and potentially taking on this project as a personal contractor. I‚Äôll leave it to y‚Äôall to get connected and explore the fit.

Let me know if there‚Äôs anything I (or Gumbo) can do to further support. Many thanks!

## Email from Stephen to Trent and Matthew

Thanks, Matthew! I'm about to take you off this thread, but I wanted to take one more opportunity to express my gratitude.

Trent, Matthew's told me amazing things about you and your work. I got the chance to check out your CV and was really impressed by your versatility. I'm sure Matthew has shared with you some about my project, but I'm working on a magazine and looking to bring a graphic designer who can complete that part of the project. I haven't seen too many 1:1 references for the project, but I'm looking to create something very maximalist, comic-book inspired, chaotic, and fun.

I'd love to hop on the phone early next week to answer any questions and have the chance to share more. I'm open next Monday and Tuesday from 10am-3pm. If neither of those work, I can find some more times. I'm looking forward to connecting on this.

Trent,

I wanted to follow up on this and see if this is still a project you would be interested in discussing further!

All Love,
Stephen J. Watts

## Email from Trent to Stephen

Hello Stephen,

Thank you so much for your kind words and for sharing your vision for the Black Mythology Project. I am most definitely interested and excited about the opportunity to collaborate on such a creative and impactful initiative. The style is definitely doable and feels like a great exercise in pushing the boundaries of design. I would love to discuss this further and explore how we can bring this vision to life together.

I'm available anytime in the afternoon this week to chat, or anytime after Friday August 9th if that works best. I'm reachable via phone at `636-515-1293` and via email at `hello@trentbrew.com`.

Looking forward to our conversation!

Best,
Trent

Thanks Trent!

How does Friday, August 9th work for you? I'll propose 1pm, but I have flexibility all day.

As a heads up, I have general stylistic expectations for the project -- but I don't have defined branding guidelines. Those are things we can discover together, if you're comfortable with that. Is there anything that you NEED me to bring to this discovery discussion?

## Email from Trent to Stephen

Hello Stephen,

Are you available during the week of August 12th? I'll be heading to California this Friday afternoon for my sister's wedding and will remain there for the rest of the month, so I'll be operating on Pacific Time, a few hours behind you. I want to ensure I'm well-settled for our conversation as I conclude a few projects with Gumbo here in Chicago. I'm free any time after 12pm CT / 10am PT that week.

I'm looking forward to the discovery phase and am eager to learn more. While I don't have specific requirements for our discussion, I do have several questions about the project to better understand its scope and our expectations. I'll have these prepared for our discussion.

Please let me know which times suit you best that week, and I'll arrange to send a calendar invite promptly.

Thanks for your understanding and flexibility!

Best regards,
Trent

## Email from Stephen to Trent

Congratulations! I hope you enjoy your time in Cali. Yes! I can do August 12th between 11am PT-  1pm PT or between 2pm PT - 4pm PT. If one of those times works for you, you can go ahead and send out a calendar invite.

Sounds good! I'll let you lead this upcoming meeting and come prepared to answer your questions well.
