Hey Rebecca üëãüèæ all is well! I'm currently wrapping up the Vistaprint mockups in Canva, then knocking out the rest of the site updates.
The dark green tasks should be 100%, light green is completed but needs review, yellow is in progress, and gray is TBD.

I did have a few questions for you:

1. Are 'reel covers' meant to be thumbnails for a particular show or producer?
2. Is there a link available for the survey button on the contact page?

Additional notes:

1. I removed the testimonials for now and replaced them with a 'become a member' section.
2. I was able to fetch page data using the Nexudus API today, but will need to tinker with it more before hooking into Webflow. I'll add the classes manually for now and will have a video walkthrough ready for you prior to launch.
3. Webflow doesn't allow password protection with the free tier, so I'll ensure we get the 'submit content' form locked down as soon as we transfer. Also, since we can't use embeds with the free tier, the forms are not working right now but they will begin to work as soon as we upgrade.
4. We hit our traffic quota today for the Instagram embed service, so it has been disabled until June 22nd. They have a $6/month plan that supports 5k visits, but I'm not sure if we'll need it. I'd also be open to building a custom integration so we can have more control over the look & feel of the feed.

I received your email regarding Docket. There are still many unknowns but I can answer some of them:

1. _What is the entire tradename? Docket TV? One word, two words, what does it look like?_

- Docket doesn't have official paperwork or a formal tradename at this time. If I had to choose, I would call it Docket TV, but would love to hear what yall think.

2. _What is the domain?_

- We own the domain `docket.tv` and all the subdomains (app.docket.tv, api.docket.tv, etc). I purchased it in March of this year, but we're looking into getting it transfered to Gumbo's GoDaddy acount, where we hold all our other domains.

3. _How much original code did you create? Did you use any existing code to create it?_

- Aside from open-source libraries and 3rd party integrations like CableCast, Docket is built entirely from scratch using a JavaScript framework called Nuxt on the front-end, NodeJS on the back-end, and a self-hosted database called PocketBase. Happy to provide more details about the tech stack if you'd like.

4. _Did you have to write an original algorithm?_

- Docket does rely on novel algorithms/architecture for its core functionality, but I believe its strength is in its UX and interoperability.

5. _Can you describe the utilitarian usage + purpose?_
   - The aim of Docket
6. _What is the functional description of Docket? (i.e., performs a task, like an invention)_
   - Docket is an all-in-one platform for real-time broadcaster, producer, and viewer interaction, designed to streamline content management, distribution, scheduling, and engagement.
7. _Is the algorithm protected from being copied off the website?_
