<!-- Subject: Introduction to Lawan + Proposed Discussion on Monday

Hi Matthew,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to introduce you to Lawan Aladefa, a colleague with whom I've had the pleasure of collaborating for several years. Lawan has a strong background in web and digital design and has expressed interest in contributing to Gumbo.

Given his expertise, I believe Lawan could significantly enhance our box-build, marketing, and branding initiatives. This collaboration could also allow me to dedicate more time to product development and internal projects, which is crucial for our upcoming goals.

You can learn more about Lawan's professional journey and portfolio through his website at studiolafa.design and his LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lawanaladefa/.

Additionally, I'd like to propose a meeting on Monday to discuss integrating Lawan into our team and to go over the final details of the NewRoot site, which is due the following day. Would you be available to sync up and explore these topics?

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Trent

Hey Matthew,

Hope you're having a great weekend. Just wanted to reach out regarding some thoughts and updates on the NewRoot site – do you have availability on Monday to sync up?

Also, I wanted to bring someone to your attention: Lawan Aladefa. We’ve been working together for a few years now, and he’s been fantastic in the areas of web and digital design. Given our current workload and the tight finances, I understand that bringing in new help can be a delicate matter, but I believe Lawan could be a valuable asset for us.

He's interested in contributing to our projects at Gumbo, particularly in handling box-build, marketing, and branding tasks. This would free me up to focus more on product development and internal projects, where I think I can add the most value.

I know it’s a big step, so I’d love to discuss this further with you. You can check out his work on his website at [studiolafa.design](http://studiolafa.design), and here's his [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lawanaladefa/) for more details. His contact information is also available on LinkedIn.

Let me know your thoughts and if you’re open to arranging a meeting to discuss this and see how we can best approach it.

Best,
Trent

I know finances are tight right now, so I'm suggesting this with caution. However, I think Lawan could help us by taking on some of the box-build, marketing, and branding tasks. This would allow me to focus more on product development and internal projects, where I believe I can make the most impact.

Hey Matthew, would you be available Monday for a quick 15min sync?


I want to introduce you to a friend of mine who I've been working with for a few years now: Lawan Aladefa. He's an excellent web and digital designer, and we've developed a really strong working relationship. Lawan and I have worked on several projects together from branding & marketing to web & mobile app design.

Lawan is currently in the process of pivoting career paths from design to IT, and he's expressed interest in helping out with our projects at Gumbo on a part-time basis. I think he could be a valuable resource for the team, and enable us to focus more on internal initiatives while providing clients with the time and expertise they need.
