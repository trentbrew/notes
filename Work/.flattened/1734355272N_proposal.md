She is seeking a website that can be referenced by prospective readers and will serve as a primary vehicle for achieving this goal. The website should be professional, informative, yet concise. It should include e-commerce functionality for users to purchase the book as well as links for 3rd party vendors such as Amazon.

Gena is also seeking a website for her consulting business, Hidden Gems Consulting. The website will serve as a cornerstone for her brand-building and client acquisition strategy. It should be professional and intuitive, aligning with the established branding of Hidden Gems Consulting. It should include a booking system for consultations and speaking engagements, integrated with a public calendar to display upcoming events. It should also include a content-rich section to showcase Gena's expertise through articles, case studies, and testimonials. It should be inviting and just different enough so that it is clear that her offerings are a cut above the rest.

>> 3. Methodology: Outline your approach to design, development, and launch, emphasizing flexibility and responsiveness to Gena's ongoing feedback.

Our methodology integrates the use of a Notion kanban board to manage the project's workflow, ensuring transparency and fostering collaboration. We will provide Gena with a link to the board, allowing her to track progress, view updates, and provide feedback in real time. This approach not only keeps the project organized but also aligns with our commitment to flexibility and responsiveness to Gena's input throughout the design, development, and launch phases.


>> 4. Timeline and Budget: Provide a clear timeline for each phase of the project, including estimated milestones and costs.

We will operate on a monthly retainer basis. This arrangement will allow us to adapt to the evolving needs of the project and provide ongoing support and enhancements as required. The initial phase of the project, which includes the design, development, and launch of the websites, is expected to span approximately 3 months, with the following tentative milestones:

**gennaovettc-suitequotient.com**

- Month 1: Completion of initial design concepts and approval.
- Month 2: Development of core website functionalities and content integration.
- Month 3: Final revisions, testing, and preparation for launch.

- Month 4: Completion of initial design concepts and approval.

>> 5. Post-launch, we will continue to offer support and iterative improvements on a monthly retainer basis, ensuring that the websites remain up-to-date and aligned with Gena's strategic goals. Specific terms and conditions of the retainer will be outlined in the contract.

>> 6. Team and Qualifications: Briefly introduce yourself and any other team members involved, showcasing
your relevant experience and skills.

>> 7. Next Steps: Specify the next steps for approval and project initiation, including contract details.

# Timeline

Each site will be broken up into 6 stages, with a check-in at the end of each stage to demo the updates and discuss next steps, followed by a retrospective call at the end of the final stage. The retro call is a time for us to get aligned & wrap-up any loose ends before transitioning into Phase 2.

Phase 1 involves a full site migration to a proprietary self-hosted solution in order to reduce costs, retain long-term ownership, mitigate risks associated with 3rd parties, and preserve the archiveâ€™s records securely and indefinitely.

This phase will be tracked across 6 stages. Typically, the discovery phase takes place first over the course of 2 weeks involving an initial consultation & brainstorming sessions. However, the discovery phase will not be necessary for this project given our close collaboration over the past 3 months.

A check-in will be scheduled at the end of each stage to demo the updates and discuss next steps, followed by a retrospective call at the end of the final stage. The retro call is a time for us to get aligned & wrap-up any loose ends before transitioning into Phase 2.

Project will kick off will be determind following the completion of Phase 1.

## Phase 1: Discovery

1. Discovery (2 weeks): Initial consultations to understand Gena's vision and requirements for the websites. Deliverables include a project brief and a detailed requirements document.
2. Research (2 weeks): Market analysis and competitor benchmarking to inform the design and functionality of the websites. Deliverables include a research report and design inspiration board.
3. Architecture (2 weeks): Planning the structure and user flow of the websites. Deliverables include wireframes and a site map.
4. Development (3 weeks): Building the core features of the websites, focusing on Webflow site design and development. Deliverables include a functional prototype and content integration.
5. Auditing (2 weeks): Reviewing the websites for quality assurance, including functionality, content, and design consistency. Deliverables include an audit report and a list of revisions.
6. Deployment & Testing (1 week): Finalizing the websites, conducting thorough testing, and preparing for launch. Deliverables include the completed websites and a launch plan.
