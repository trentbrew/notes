# Market Analysis

---

### Target Market

1. **_Startups:_** Gumbo Media will build custom web, mobile, and desktop applications for early stage start-ups. Startups often have unique technological requirements and a need for innovative software solutions to support their growth and establish a competitive advantage.
  - The global startup investment trends for 2023 indicate a significant shift from previous years. The total global startup investment in 2023 was $285 billion, marking a 38% decline from the $462 billion invested in 2022. This reduction in funding was observed across all stages of venture funding. Early-stage funding saw a decrease of more than 40% year over year, late-stage funding by 37%, and seed funding just over 30%. Despite this downturn, the overall funding in 2023 was down by less than 20% compared to the pre-pandemic years of 2018 to 2020.
  - The U.S. remained the largest startup investment market, accounting for about half of all venture funding. Funding to U.S.-based startups in 2023 totaled $138 billion, a decrease of 37% from the previous year.
  - Interestingly, while most industries saw a downturn in funding, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was a significant exception. Global funding for AI startups reached close to $50 billion in 2023, up by 9% from the $45.8 billion invested in 2022. This growth in AI investment is highlighted by the substantial fundings received by foundation model companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Inflection AI, which collectively raised $18 billion in 2023.
  - Other sectors that also saw increased investment in 2023 include semiconductors and battery technology. However, sectors like Web3 experienced a significant decline, falling 73% year over year from $28 billion to $7.6 billion.
  - The fourth quarter of 2023 marked the lowest quarter for global venture funding in the year, with quarterly funding totaling $58 billion, down 24% quarter over quarter and 25% year over year. Seed funding in Q4 was $7 billion, down just over 20% from $9 billion the previous year. Early-stage funding in Q4 was around $23 billion, down 32% year over year, and late-stage funding in Q4 reached $28.6 billion, a decrease of about 20%.
  - These statistics indicate a more cautious and disciplined approach from venture capital investors, reflecting a shift in the global startup funding landscape. This trend is expected to continue, making the environment for startup founders more challenging in 2024.
  - In light of these statistics, Gumbo Media's focus on providing affordable development and design services, strategic guidance, and technical expertise to startups becomes even more crucial. As the startup market continues to evolve, Gumbo Media's efforts can play a significant role in supporting startups, particularly those with underrepresented founders. Additionally, considering Black Ambition Prize ([blackambitionprize.com](http://blackambitionprize.com/)) as a potential funding resource can be beneficial, as it offers opportunities and support to Black and Latinx entrepreneurs.

   - **_Growth:_** Small businesses are ripe for innovation, as they are often more agile and flexible than larger companies, which can make it easier for them to adapt to new technologies and trends. Additionally, small businesses often have less bureaucracy and fewer layers of management, which can make it easier for them to implement new ideas quickly.

# Financial Projections

---

### Operating Expenses

- **_Software Services & Tools:_**
  - **_Figma_** (Design): `$12 per seat/month | 3 seats | Total: $36/month` // We could share a single account
  - **_~~Adobe Creative Cloud_** (Design): `$?/month`~~ // Removed in favor of Figma?
  - **_GitHub_** (Dev): `$3.67 per user/month | 3 users | Total: $11/month`
  - **_Vercel_** (Hosting): `$20 per user/month | 3 users | Total: $60/month` // We could share a single account
- **_Metered Costs:_**
  - **_Gemini_** (Generative AI): `$0/month` // Gemini is currently in beta and is free to use
  - **_OpenAI_** (Generative AI): `$???/month` // [OpenAI is priced per API call](https://openai.com/pricing). We will use Gemini for now, but we may need to switch to OpenAI in the future if Gemini is no longer free. Monthly costs will depend on the number of API calls we make, and could be significant. Monetization strategies for AI integration could include charging clients a fixed monthly fee for using AI features.
  - **_Amazon Web Services_** (Storage): $???/month // [AWS S3 pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc%2F%3Fp&c=ml&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all). S3 will only become necessary once we start storing large amounts of data. We could also use PocketBase for storage until then, which is free up to 1GB. Monthly costs will depend on the amount of data we store and will likely be negligible.
  - **_Stripe_** (eCommerce): `$0/month` // Stripe is free to use, but a 2.9% + $0.30 fee is charged for each transaction. We could pass this fee on to the client or include it in our pricing.
  - **_PocketHost_** (Development): `$0/month` // PocketHost offers a free forever tier for its service, which includes unlimited (fair use) CPU, bandwidth, and storage.
    - **_Streamable_** (Storage): `$8.99/month` // Streamable is great for hosting, streaming, and embedding videos that are too large for PocketBase. It is free to use, but the free plan only allows for 250MB of storage. The $8.99/month plan allows for 500GB of storage which should be more than enough for our needs.
- **_Other:_**
  - **_Notion_** (Project Management): `$0 per user/month` // Personal Notion accounts are free and we can leverage the free tier for now. We may need to upgrade to a paid plan in the future if we need more features.
  - **_Zapier_** (Automation): `$19/month` // Zapier is free for two-step zaps, but we will likely need to upgrade to a paid plan in the future if we need more features. Starter plan is $19/month and allows for multi-step zaps which will be necessary for the AI automation service as well as internal workflows.

Total: `$134.99/month`

> Please note, this total doesn't include potential costs for OpenAI, AWS S3, or any future upgrades to Notion or other services. It is important that potential future costs or investments that may become relevant as we scale are discussed and accounted for in our pricing model.

# Processes & Workflows

---

### Kanban

[Kanban](https://www.planview.com/resources/guide/introduction-to-kanban/kanban-vs-scrum/) is a workflow method that focuses on visualizing work, limiting work in progress, and maximizing efficiency. Unlike other agile methodologies, Kanban does not prescribe specific roles, time frames, or ceremonies, making it more adaptable and less prescriptive. It is characterized by its flexibility and ability to accommodate changes easily, making it suitable for teams that require a less structured approach to agile project management.

The Kanban process involves visualizing the workflow using a Kanban board, which typically consists of columns such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." Work items are represented as cards on the board, allowing the team to track the flow of their project and understand the current, completed, and future tasks. The methodology emphasizes making small and gradual changes to the existing setup, and it does not require a specific initial setup, making it easy to implement. Kanban is designed to deliver work in a quick and efficient way, with a focus on continuous delivery and minimal resistance to change. Gumbo will use Notion Kanban boards to track progress on projects and manage tasks.

An example of Kanban in Notion can be found [here](https://trentbrew.notion.site/5cf0df5c293445e6b7e69458f3899d59?v=d56d544794bb4a45a1c04a9623b8cbe5&pvs=25).

# Project Lifecycle

### Client Onboarding

1. **_Discovery ( assignees: all ):_** We start by meeting with the client to discuss their needs and goals. We ask questions about their business, their target market, their competitors, and their vision for the project. We also ask questions about their budget, timeline, and other constraints. This helps us understand what the client is looking for and allows us to provide them with a proposal that meets their needs.

2. **_Analysis ( assignees: all )_**: We analyze the client's requirements and determine the best approach for the project. We also identify any potential issues or challenges that may arise during the project and come up with solutions to address them. This step involves market research, competitive analysis, and technical feasibility analysis.

3. **_Proposal ( assignees: all ):_** We create a proposal that outlines the scope of work, timeline, and cost for the project. We also include a list of deliverables and milestones so that the client knows exactly what they will be getting from us. This helps us set expectations with the client and ensures that we are on the same page before we start working together.

4. **_Contract ( assignees: all ):_** We create a contract that outlines the terms of the project, including payment terms, intellectual property rights, and other legal issues. This helps us protect ourselves from liability and ensures that both parties are clear about their responsibilities.

### Project Management

5. **_Kanban Setup ( assignees: TBD ):_** We set up the project management system within the Notion Wiki to track progress on the project. This involves creating a Kanban board, adding tasks to the board, and assigning tasks to team members.

### System Architecture & Design

UI/UX and System Architecture will kick off simultaneously.

6. **_UI/UX Design ( assignees: TBD ):_** We create a design for the project based on the client's requirements. This includes wireframes, mockups, and prototypes that show how the final product will look and function. We also provide feedback on the design to ensure that it meets the client's needs and expectations. The deliverables for this step include a design document, a style guide, and a prototype.

7. **_System Architecture ( assignees: TBD ):_** In tandem with the UI, we design the system architecture for the project based on the client's requirements. This includes defining the data model, designing the database schema, and creating a technical architecture diagram. We also provide feedback on the architecture to ensure that it meets the client's needs and expectations. This step does not involve any coding or development work, but it is an important part of the project lifecycle because it helps us understand how the system will work and what technologies we will need to use. The deliverables for this step include a system architecture document and a technical architecture diagram.

8. **_GitHub Repository ( assignees: TBD ):_** We set up a version control system for the project using GitHub. This allows us to track changes made to the code and revert back to previous versions if necessary. It also helps us collaborate with other developers who may be working on the project at the same time. The deliverables for this step include a GitHub repository and a README file that explains how to use the repository. Internal best practices and guidelines for Git and GitHub will be documented in the Notion Wiki.

### Development

8. **_Front-end Development ( assignees: TBD ):_** We develop the project using the latest technologies and best practices. This includes writing code using JavaScript frameworks for web apps, and with Flutter for Android & iOS apps. Front-end development is an iterative process that involves continuous feedback from the client and the team.

9. **_Back-end Development ( assignees: TBD ):_** In tandem with the front-end, we develop the back-end of the project using the latest technologies and best practices. This includes writing APIs, integrating 3rd party services, setting up databases, managing microservices, and deploying the project to production. Back-end development is an iterative process that involves continuous feedback from the client and the team.

> This is a simplified version of the project lifecycle. The actual process may vary depending on the project requirements and client needs.

### Deployment & DevOps

10. **_Domain & Hosting ( assignees: TBD ):_** We set up a domain name for the project and host it on a server. This allows us to make the project accessible to the public. The deliverables for this step include a domain name and a hosting plan. Internal best practices and guidelines for domain & hosting will be documented in the Notion Wiki.

11. **_Deployment ( assignees: TBD ):_** At the end of each week, we deploy the project to production using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs) and provide ongoing support for the project after it has been launched. This includes monitoring the system, fixing bugs, and adding new features as needed. We also provide training for the client's team so that they can maintain the system themselves. Vercel is integrated with GitHub, which allows us to deploy the project automatically whenever we push changes to the repository. Internal best practices and guidelines for Vercel will be documented in the Notion Wiki.

Hey Matthew, just wanted to provide a quick update on the writing app and future SAAS projects.

As you know, I initially planned to publish the app as a basic writing/SEO tool similar to Google Docs but with AI features. It's currently just a (very) basic WYSIWYG editor with a prompt to generate content. The prototype can be found at https://app.brevity.ink – It's a start, but the vision I have for the app is much bigger than this.

The original concept was to allow users to input their website so the system could learn their brand voice and generate consistent content (see output.md for a working example from Living Cities), but I recently discovered a tool that is doing something similar ([strut.so](https://strut.so/)) and also executes the UX exactly as I had envisioned ~ There are a few other tools that are similar as writing tools are hot right now. They are all for generating long-form content in one shot which takes away a lot of the humanity from the content. This is a good thing for academic papers but not for blog posts & articles.

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPoM-h1fK8M&t=555s) from Maggie Appleton describes my concern with this apprach better than I could. Her [blog](https://maggieappleton.com/garden) has been a huge inspiration for me and I think approaching the UX from the perspective of "note-taking & knowledge capture" vs "content generation" could redirect the app in a more meaningful direction.

The following are some highlights from my research that I think are relevant to this discussion:


I have a ton of thoughts that I couldn't possibly fit into this email, but I'd love to discuss this further with you on Monday and get your feedback on (1) the direction of the app and whether it's worth pursuing (2) how the app could fit into the Gumbo ecosystem whether internally or as a product offering (3) how we could leverage the app to generate revenue and/or attract new clients.





 I'm also happy to share my notes and research on this topic if you're interested.
