Hello üëãüèæ Nice to meet you! My name is Trenton Brew. I've been working with Tenia Davil (@zenlien27) on a Wordpress site that you recently developed. We are urgently needing access/ownership to the original domain so that we can access the DNS settings for an urgent bug fix. It would be helpful to know what registrar/provider was used to purchase the domain, whether I can be added as an admin, and how we can proceed. I'm reachable by email at hello@trentbrew.com and by phone at +1 636 515 1293. Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you!

Hi, I'm sorry I don't know you! And I can't provide any information just because you have provided a reference. Those are confidential information. Please if you work with her, please tell her to contact me, and provide me the consent for that.

Hello, your concern is totally understandable. I've asked Tenia to reach out to you to confirm that I am the developer on her new website. Let me know once you've recieved confirmation from her and feel free to reach out using the contact info I've provided in the previous message. Thanks again

Also on the hosting I have to check if that is still available and I can retrieve the data or not.

If not, would you be able to add Tenia and I as an admin so that we can update the pyment information and access the DNS records?

I mentioned that the domain has been expired. You can search it again. I'm sure it will be available for you to purchase.

I can request the hosting to download the website data, which you dan upload to your new server.

I understand that it's expired, but I'm still unable to purchase the domain through GoDaddy. Even thought it's expired I believe you should still be able to access the dashboard and add new admins on the account so we can update the pyment info. Please confirm whether this is possible. I'm happy to hop on a call to resolve the issue together if that's best. I'm reachable via e-mail at helloÔº†trentbrew.com

I believe your purchasing the wrong domain, it was www.leadership-wise.com

You're right, that's the the correct domain. However, it's still not available for purchase either.

Do you still have access to the DNS settings for the domain by chance?

No, unless I purchase it, or it's parked only then I have the access to DNS settings.

Good morning, I spoke with GoDaddy Customer Support today and they informed me that you should still have access to the domain settings to transfer to another user. I'd like to confirm over a call if possible whether we can transfer from the GoDaddy dashboard please. Tenia is losing book sales due to the domain not working and there's nothing I can do on my end without access to the DNS and your help would be much appreciated. I'm reachable via e-mail at helloÔº†trentbrew.com and by phone at 6365151293. Thanks so much

Hi again. This is the last you will hear from me I promise lol

Thankfully Tenia was able to secure her original domain. However, the admin portal for the WordPress site is broken since the domain was disconnected (https://www.leadership-wise.com/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=page), and I'm unable to access the site settings to reconnect the domain. As far as my understanding the site was created under your own WordPress account but correct me if that's inaccurate. Could you assist me in reconnecting the domain to the original WordPress site?

Thank you for your patience and understanding by the way. There is not much I can do on my end as I'm not the owner of the WordPress account, so your help is much appreciated.

I don't have the WordPress account. Her website was developed using WordPress cms, a hosting server was used for that, and that is expired too. I can request the server owner if they still have the website backup available. I sent her a messages stating all of that, she didn't get back to me.

I see. I'm sorry to hear that Tenia never got back to you. We've decided to rebuild the assessment using a different platform so we won't need the WordPress credentials anymore. Thanks again for your help and for your time. Best of luck with your future projects üôèüèæ
