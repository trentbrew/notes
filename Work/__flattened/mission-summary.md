Mission Summary:

The mission, dubbed "Operation Sea Turtle", involves transitioning your freelance clients to Gumbo Media, a company where you work as a web/graphic designer. The clients in question are Dr. Ashley P., Tenia Davis of Leadershipwise, and Gena Lovett of Hidden Gems Consulting.

Dr. Ashley, who you've recently completed a project for, approached you for ongoing website maintenance and creative support. You initially agreed to an independent arrangement with her, but after discussions with Matthew and the Ops team at Gumbo Media, it was decided that her retainer should be routed through Gumbo Media. Dr. Ashley has agreed to this new arrangement.

You are now considering transitioning your other two clients, Tenia and Gena, to Gumbo Media. Tenia is currently on an active retainer with you, and Gena recently inquired about website development for her book. Matthew Manning of Gumbo Media has outlined how to proceed with these transitions.

Roles:

- Your Role: You are tasked with communicating with Tenia and Gena about the transition to Gumbo Media. You are also responsible for gathering relevant documentation and communications to provide to Gumbo Media for a successful transition.

- My Role: As your code assistant, I'm here to help you manage this transition process. This could involve helping draft communications, manage documentation, or any other tasks you need assistance with.

- Matthew's Role: Matthew is providing guidance on how to proceed with the transitions. He has also asked for any relevant communications you've had with both clients to help with scoping the projects in Gumbo's Sales portal.

- Dr. Ashley's Role: Dr. Ashley is a client who has agreed to have her retainer routed through Gumbo Media instead of an independent arrangement with you.

- Tenia's Role: Tenia is a client who you are considering transitioning to Gumbo Media. She is currently on an active retainer with you.

- Gena's Role: Gena is a client who recently inquired about website development for her book. You are considering transitioning her to Gumbo Media.

- Sales Team's Role: The Sales team at Gumbo Media will use the communications and documentation you provide to scope out the projects for Tenia and Gena.
