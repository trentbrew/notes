# Cost Estimate

The Lincoln Institute of Land Policy has a robust history of funding and supporting significant projects and research initiatives. They are a well-established nonprofit think tank with a focus on land policy, aiming to improve quality of life through various policy interventions. Their financial backing comes from a combination of their endowment, grants, and partnerships with other organizations [1†](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Institute_of_Land_Policy) [2†](https://www.lincolninst.edu/es/courses/2024/fundamentals-municipal-finance-credential/).

While specific budget details for individual projects are not typically disclosed publicly, the Institute's broad scope of work and global reach indicate a strong financial foundation. They support diverse initiatives including capacity building, research, and policy development across various regions, from the United States to Latin America and Asia [1†](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Institute_of_Land_Policy) [3†](https://www.guidestar.org/profile/86-6021106).

Given their comprehensive support for similar large-scale, data-driven projects and their collaboration with other institutions, it is likely that a project budget in the range of $53,000 - $99,000 for the GSE Loan Purchase Dashboard could be within their capacity, especially if it aligns with their goals of improving public policy and land use [2†](https://www.lincolninst.edu/es/courses/2024/fundamentals-municipal-finance-credential/).

To confirm this, we might consider reaching out directly to their procurement or project management teams, as they regularly issue Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and may provide specific guidance or budget ranges for upcoming projects [3†](https://www.guidestar.org/profile/86-6021106).

## High-level Breakdown:

The cost estimate for a team of two (a developer and a project manager) to develop the GSE Loan Purchase Dashboard for the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy is based on the following factors:

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**

   - **Cost Estimate:** $3,000 - $5,000
   - **Timeframe:** 1-2 weeks (40-80 hours)
   - **Tasks:** Gathering and cleaning data from Recursion for dashboard use.
   - **Note:** The developer's familiarity with the data source and tools may streamline this phase.

2. **Design Phase**

   - **Cost Estimate:** $8,000 - $12,000
   - **Timeframe:** 3 weeks (120 hours)
   - **Tasks:** Create wireframes, gather user feedback using Figma, and design the UI/UX.
   - **Note:** Efficient collaboration between the developer and project manager can reduce the time needed.

3. **Development Phase**

   - **Cost Estimate:** $25,000 - $50,000
   - **Timeframe:** 8-10 weeks (320-400 hours)
   - **Tasks:** Full-stack development using Vue, Nuxt, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI, Node.js, TypeScript, Express, Hono, PocketBase, and Apache ECharts.
   - **Note:** The developer will handle the bulk of the hands-on work, ensuring the technical aspects are robust and functional.

4. **Testing Phase**

   - **Cost Estimate:** $3,000 - $7,000
   - **Timeframe:** 2-3 weeks (80-120 hours)
   - **Tasks:** Comprehensive testing and usability improvements.
   - **Note:** With a smaller team, testing may be more straightforward but could require more iterative cycles.

5. **Deployment Phase**

   - **Cost Estimate:** $2,000 - $4,000
   - **Timeframe:** 1 week (40 hours)
   - **Tasks:** Securely deploy the dashboard using Vercel and PocketHost, and train administrators and users.
   - **Note:** Deployment tools like Vercel simplify this process, reducing costs.

6. **Support and Maintenance**

   - **Cost Estimate:** $8,000 - $15,000 (annually)
   - **Timeframe:** Ongoing
   - **Tasks:** Post-launch support and ongoing maintenance.
   - **Note:** With a single developer, ongoing support might need to be more comprehensive to ensure reliability.

7. **Project Management**
   - **Cost Estimate:** $4,000 - $6,000
   - **Tasks:** Project management, team coordination, and milestone delivery using Notion.
   - **Note:** The project manager's role is crucial for ensuring smooth progress and timely delivery.

**Total Cost Estimate:** $53,000 - $99,000

## Hourly Breakdown:

To calculate the approximate hourly rate for both the developer and the project lead, we need to consider the total estimated cost and the total number of hours expected to be worked over the project timeline.

### Total Estimated Cost

The total cost estimate for the project is between $53,000 and $99,000.

### Total Project Duration

The project duration is estimated to be 18-20 weeks. For simplicity, let's use 19 weeks as the average duration.

### Weekly Hours

Assuming a standard 40-hour work week, the total number of hours for the project is:
19 weeks \* 40 hours/week = 760 hours

### Cost Allocation

Let's assume the developer will spend twice as much time on the project as the project lead. This means the developer will work 2/3 of the total hours, and the project lead will work 1/3 of the total hours.

### Hourly Rate Calculation

1. **Lower Bound Estimate:**

   - Total cost: $53,000
   - Developer's cost: $53,000 \* 2/3 = $35,333.33
   - Project lead's cost: $53,000 \* 1/3 = $17,666.67
   - Developer's hours: 760 \* 2/3 = 506.67 hours
   - Project lead's hours: 760 \* 1/3 = 253.33 hours
   - Developer's hourly rate: $35,333.33 / 506.67 hours ≈ $69.72/hour
   - Project lead's hourly rate: $17,666.67 / 253.33 hours ≈ $69.72/hour

2. **Upper Bound Estimate:**

   - Total cost: $99,000
   - Developer's cost: $99,000 \* 2/3 = $66,000
   - Project lead's cost: $99,000 \* 1/3 = $33,000
   - Developer's hours: 760 \* 2/3 = 506.67 hours
   - Project lead's hours: 760 \* 1/3 = 253.33 hours
   - Developer's hourly rate: $66,000 / 506.67 hours ≈ $130.23/hour
   - Project lead's hourly rate: $33,000 / 253.33 hours ≈ $130.23/hour

### Approximate Hourly Rates

- **Developer:**

  - Lower Bound: $69.72/hour
  - Upper Bound: $130.23/hour

- **Project Lead:**

  - Lower Bound: $69.72/hour
  - Upper Bound: $130.23/hour

### Summary

The estimated hourly rate for both the developer and the project lead ranges from $69.72 to $130.23 per hour, reflecting the variability in the total project cost. This range provides a practical estimate for budgeting.

## Alternative Cost Models:

- **Fixed Price Model (value-based):** The total cost may be determined upfront by assessing the project's value to the client rather than just the scope of work. This approach emphasizes the project's impact and benefits, ensuring the price reflects the value delivered. It provides cost predictability but requires a thorough understanding of the client's needs and the project's potential outcomes.
- **Productized Service Model (subscription-based):** Develop a custom solution at a reduced rate, standardize it for broader use, and offer it as a subscription service. This model provides scalability, recurring revenue, and efficiency by leveraging a standardized product. (Similar approach as Docket TV)
