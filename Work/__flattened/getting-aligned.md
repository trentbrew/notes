<!-- Thank you for providing the additional context. Here are my thoughts: -->

Gena's Project (Hidden Gems Consulting):

Gena's project involves creating a professional and unique website for her consulting business, Hidden Gems Consulting (HGC). The website should reflect her brand and services, which include manufacturing operational excellence, professional executive coaching, and cultural consulting.

Gena's approach sets her apart from competitors as she not only provides analysis and a roadmap for improvement but also partners with clients through the implementation process and checks in post-implementation.

The website should include e-commerce functionality for users to purchase her book, a booking system for consultations and speaking engagements, video content of her talks/lectures, and supplementary articles & blog posts.

Tenia's Project (Leadershipwise):

Tenia Davis, Ph.D., runs Leadershipwise, a consultancy specializing in servant leadership. She needs a website redesign to promote her book and consulting services, including integrating training modules. She also requires video editing for online training courses, a social media strategy, and a marketing strategy for her book and services.

Transitioning to Gumbo Media:

Given the scope of these projects, transitioning them to Gumbo Media could provide additional resources and support to ensure their success. However, it's important to communicate this transition carefully to Tenia and Gena to maintain their trust and ensure they understand the benefits of this change.

Your Contract with Gumbo Media:

The impact of these transitions on your contract with Gumbo Media is something to discuss with Matthew. It's crucial to ensure that you are appropriately staffed on the projects you bring in and that the terms of your contract reflect the additional work and responsibility these projects entail.

Next Steps:

Before your meeting with Matthew, it might be helpful to prepare a list of key points to discuss, including the specifics of the new contracts with Tenia and Gena, the impact on your contract with Gumbo Media, and any potential challenges or concerns you foresee with these transitions.

<!-- Please let me know if there's anything specific you'd like assistance with in preparing for this meeting or managing these projects. -->
