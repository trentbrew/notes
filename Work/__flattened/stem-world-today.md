## Market Analysis

STEM World Today’s target market are tweens and teens - “Generation Alpha” and primarily “Generation Z” youth, ages 10 – 17, and 18 – 25. Gen Z alone is expected to become the largest generation of consumers with over $360 Billion in disposable income, according to a Bloomberg report. In the United States, there are over 43 million youth between the ages of 10 – 19 making up 13% of the population in 2021 (source: U.S. Census Bureau). Regarding gender, 49% of the U.S. youth population are counted as female and 51% male. It should also be noted that around 1.6 million youth aged 13 – 17 (0.6%) identify as transgender.

Diversity is greater in the child population than in the adult U.S. population. As of 2018 50% were described as white/Caucasian, 25% Latinx, 14% Black, 5% Asian, 4% multi-racial (ethnic), 1% American Indian/Alaska Native, and 0.5% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander. Approximately 86% of children lived in metropolitan areas, while 8% live in micropolitan areas. Median family income of U.S. households with children was $77,445, decreasing with only one spouse present – women $30,681 and with men $47,375. This fluctuates by State, e.g., New York State media income was $83,272 (women only $32,193; men only $49, 654).

The U.S. market size for magazine publishing is around $30 billion, with Consumer Magazines accounting for $24.1 billion and Business Magazines at $5.9 billion. Technology is disrupting the traditional business models of the $16 billion educational publishing industry, putting more emphasis on delivery of online courses and course material across the grade spectrum and in meeting the demand for professional development services for educators. E-textbooks, video-streaming, digital delivery, gaming, and cloud computing are the catchwords of educational publishing.

According to HolonIQ, the Global EdTech market is on pace to reach $341 billion by 2025. An aggressive acceleration in venture capital invested through 2018 reached a record $8 billion. Education focused Artificial Intelligence (AI) on its own, is expected to be a $6 billion market by 2025. Evidenced in October 2018 when MIT announced a $1 billion fund to create a new college that combines AI, machine learning and data science with other academic disciplines – the largest financial investment by any US academic institute at the time.

A market research study published by Custom Market Insights, found that the demand analysis of the U.S. Education Market size/share revenue was valued at approximately $1.4 trillion in 2021 and is expected to reach around $3.1 trillion by 2030, at a CAGR of 4.2% between 2022 and 2030. The key market players listed in the report with their sales, revenues and strategies are Smart Technologies, Wall Family Enterprise, Adobe Systems, Pearson Plc, Tata Interactive Systems, Saba Software, Promethean Inc., AWE Acquisitions, Cisco, and others.
