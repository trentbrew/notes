## Feedback from Erin Chapman

### General Impressions
The website is improved since I saw it last. I like the brighter colors.

### Montage of Images
I'd like the montage of images along the left to include more women, especially if possible, images of the women who populate the histories I've written. I'm thinking of blueswomen like Ethel Waters and Bessie Smith and lesser-known performers like Clara Smith and Nora Holt. Also writers like Nella Larsen and Jessie Fauset, and social workers like Elise Johnson McDougald. Some of these women are relatively obscure, so photos of them may be available in the public domain. If not, I'd rather include more of the original designs already used in the site than photos of people I don't recognize or images for which the provenance is obscure to me. Also, a lot of the dull colors I dislike originate with these photos/images. If it's not feasible to get images of the sort I'd prefer, let's let the cover of *Prove It On Me* do the work of representing the history of the New Negro era of the 1920s.

### Scholarship Focus
My scholarship overall is about sexual/gender politics and radicalism, particularly as they are manifest in the popular culture of the 20th century United States. Perhaps that helps unmoor the images to be used on the site from the 1920s iconography your team has seemed to take inspiration from so far.

### Lorraine Hansberry Section
Of course, Lorraine Hansberry is appropriately prominent as the montage continues as I scroll down, but the quote you've used is not particularly relevant to my analysis of her life and work. I've attached a brief excerpt from my writings on Lorraine Hansberry. This excerpt may not end up in the final book, but it is original and reflects an aspect of my interpretation of Lorraine's life. It should be situated within the website parallel to the way that the *Prove It On Me* cover is situated. The working title of the Lorraine Hansberry book is *American Radical: Lorraine Hansberry and the Struggle to Save the United States*. If the publicity photo of Lorraine included in the word doc is copyrighted and therefore not a feasible addition to the website, that's fine.

Please nix the Hansberry quote that's in the draft website. Please replace it with this quote I prefer:

> “Let no Negro artist who thinks himself deserving of the title take pen to paper—or, for that matter, body to dance or voice to speech or song—if in doing so the content of that which he presents or performs suggests to the nations of the world that our people do not yet languish under privation and hatred and brutality and political oppression in every state of the forty-eight. The truth demands its own equals. Therefore, let an America that respects its name and aspirations in the world anticipate the novels and plays and poetry of Negro writers that must now go forth to an eager world. For we are going to tell the truth from all its sides, including what is still the bitter epic of the black man in this most hostile nation.”
> — Lorraine Hansberry, 1959

### Additional Images
As the viewer scrolls through the site, it might be useful to include images of people with whom Lorraine is associated such as Alice Childress, Paul Robeson, Louis Burnham, Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis, Sidney Poitier, Nina Simone, and Amiri Baraka/LeRoi Jones. Lesser-known images of civil liberties and civil rights protests, especially in Chicago and NYC, would also be appropriate.
