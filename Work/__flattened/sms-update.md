Hi Trent! Just wanted to informally check in with you about the website progress. I made a bunch of updates to the work on doc with suggested edits last week. Were you able to make those yet? Let me know if you have questions!

# Trent - Thursday · 8:52 PM

Hey Rebecca 👋🏾 all is welll!

I'm currently wrapping up the Vistaprint mockups for your review and finishing the site updates. Dark green tasks are 100%, light green needs review, yellow is in progress, and gray is TBD.

A couple of questions:

1. Are 'reel covers' thumbnails for a specific show or producer?
2. Is there a link for the survey button on the contact page?

Notes:

- We've reached the meximum number of pages on free tier, so I'm thinking maybe the watch page can link directly to docket in the meantime but let me know what you think.
- You may have noticed the Instagram embed isn't working due to hitting our monthly quota but it will resume on June 22nd.

There are a lot of moving parts so please don't hessitate to reach out I miss something or if you need anything at all

# Rebecca - Thursday · 8:52 PM

Doing great here, Trent! Same to you!

Thank you for the updates!

1. Can't wait to see the mockups!

2. I'm not sure the reel thumbnails are necessary. Let me look into that. If we move forward, it would be for any reel we publish to give the feed a consistent look and feel. See the current reels. Again, might not be necessary.

3. Survey link is https://bit.ly/speakmpls_2024survey

4. Do we need to temp pay for a paid version for the 2.0 site while it's in development? I'm willing to do that to get the Watch page set up!

5. For IG quota, what is the quota for? Also, is quota always in place or just on the free tier of the development page? What's the price for unlimited?

6. Could you send me the docket page link again? The last time I checked on it, the schedules and what what was airing still wasn't lining up.

7. Before we launch, we'll need to take a look at the mobile view of new site.

Bonus: I just read the Docket Manifesto, and OMG!!!! So excited! It's so great! I have lots of ideas!

# Trent - Tuesday · 6:00AM

Hey Rebecca,

I hope you had a great weekend!

Thank you for your patience on the site updates. The workplan is up-to-date and I think everything is in a good spot.

1. The IG quota is for 2000 visits per month, and the pro version is $6/month but I went ahead and created a new account so we can continue to use the free tier. The IG feed should showup on site 1.0 and 2.0 now.

2. I was able to repurpose the old events page as the watch page, so that should be live now.

3. The docket link is `https://app.docket.tv/watch`. The schedule sync seems to be working much better than before, but not perfect. I'll continue to monitor and setup some automated tests so we can ensure it's bulletproof.

4. The mobile site should be working well now. I did remove the docket embed from mobile since docket is not mobile-ready but that will be the next highest priority on the development side.

I'd love to book some time for us this week for us to review the site and vistaprint mockups together.

# Trent - 1:27pm

Hey Matthew, I'm gonna go ahead and meet with Rebecca today at 4:30 CT. We'll just be discussing the docket demo for the conference and will book a separate call for next week to review the website updates & other deliverables.
I should be home in about an hour and will send an invite once i'm back. You're most welcome to join of course, but i understand if not since it's a Friday :+1::skin-tone-5: i'll be sure to send a summary of the call afterwards (edited)

# Matthew - 4:19 PM

Sounds good, Trent. I'll be off this call as I'm completing some other work. But best of luck!

- Debrief for Matthew

  - Braindump

    - Our aim is to launch the new site on Monday, in time for Wednesday’s conference. We walked through every page together and
    - The final steps on my end are to cleanup the mobile version which I completed over the weekend, then walking through the full migration in realtime with Rebecca.
    - Rebecca expressed that she’s really happy with SPEAK 2.0 and that she has lots more ideas (as do I), and would be open to extending our collaboration beyond this launch, focusing on Nexudus integration and other features. SPEAK 2.1 if you will. This is not a priority for the conference but I'd love to discuss this further with you.

    - Rebecca was very happy with the VistaPrint designs. The final picks are as follows:
      - Tent: Option 7 (with slight tweaks)
      - Table Runner: Option 2 (with slight tweaks)
      - Banner: Option 1 (no edits)
      - Merch: Rebecca loved all of the designs, especially for the T-Shirt (no edits)
    - I'll be sending over the following by EOD:
      - Raw files for VistaPrint designs (PNG, JPEG, SVG)
      - Links to each of the VistaPrint products and their sizes/dimensions
      - Canva versions of the VistaPrint designs for future edits (the originals were done in Figma)

# Draft (Sunday, Jun 23)

Hey Matthew,

Wanted to quickly fill you in on the call with Rebecca this past Friday. Here is an overview of where we’re at:

1. Website 2.0 + TV Guide

- We walked through the site together and Rebecca is very happy with the progress. The site is ready to launch on Monday, in time for the conference on Wednesday. Rebecca proposed that we meet on Monday afternoon to walk through the final migration steps together. I sent an invite for 2pm CT but let me know if that time works for you, or if you’d like to join.
- Final steps on my end are to cleanup the mobile version and ensure the docket embed is bug-free. I completed the mobile updates over the weekend and currently auditing the TV Guide. Any other final changes will be made during our call on Monday.
- Rebecca expressed that she’s really happy with SPEAK 2.0 and that she has lots more ideas (as do I), and would be open to extending our collaboration beyond this launch, focusing on Nexudus integration and other features. SPEAK 2.1 if you will. This is not a priority for the conference but I'd love to discuss this further with you.
