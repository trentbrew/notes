Hi Gena, I hope you're well.

I'm sorry to hear the Web Design & Development package is out of your budget range.

The pricing model is in place to ensure the process is simple and affordable, while preserving the quality of the work. I believe it's important for small businesses & individuals to have access to quality web design & development services, and I've found that the retainer model is the best way to achieve that.

I'm passionate about the work I do and often find myself spending extra time on each project. To manage this, I cap my weekly hours at 12 (52 per month) per project, which breaks down to $8.65 per hour. This rate is consistent for all my clients and is set to ensure the sustainability of my services while remaining accessible. I apologize if this was not clear in the proposal.

Work has already begun on your project, and the working draft can be found here: https://hiddengemsconsulting.webflow.io/

If the pricing model is a concern, I'm open to discussing alternative options for the remaining deliverables. I would also be happy to grant you full access to the current working draft.

I'd love to continue working together and look forward to hearing from you.

Best,

Trenton Brew

Hi Trent,

Thanks for submitting your proposal. I have reviewed and the fee, particularly the $450 per month after the creation is unexpected and too much given I’ve not yet begun to profit from any sales
