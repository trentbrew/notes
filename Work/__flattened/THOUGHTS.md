Essentially, this is a personal knowledge management tool for language learning. It's also a kind of social network for language learning. It's a community-powered content platform... Instead of one company curating the same content for everyone, users curate their own content and share it with others. It's a decentralized educational social learning network.

My instinct/assumption is that most folks experience this kind of thing through like a discord or facebook group. This is more open and accessible. No invite required (to my knowledge).

So... _is the community aspect a feature or a product?_?
