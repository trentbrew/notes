Here’s a breakdown of key factors to consider and the steps we’ll need to take, aligning with our goal of preparing for a future sale:

### 1. **LLC Structure Advantages**:
   - **Ownership and Asset Clarity**: Forming a new LLC (for Docket.tv) gives all three partners a formal ownership structure (33.3% each), making it clear who owns the assets, IP, and liabilities. This simplifies future sale negotiations, as potential buyers prefer acquiring a single entity that holds all key assets.
   - **Limited Liability**: Each partner’s personal assets are protected in case of any legal issues or debts, which isn’t always as clear in a joint venture.
   - **Ease of Transfer**: An LLC can be easily transferred or sold as a whole, which makes it attractive to buyers. It also enables smoother transition of equity and profits.
   - **Tax Flexibility**: We can elect for the LLC to be taxed as a partnership, S-corp, or C-corp, depending on our long-term financial strategy (e.g., selling shares versus assets).

### 2. **Joint Venture Considerations**:
   - While a joint venture avoids setting up a new entity, it creates complexities in managing multiple existing LLCs, especially regarding IP ownership, profit distribution, and taxation.
   - Assigning or dividing IP, contracts, and liabilities across multiple businesses could make the future sale less appealing to buyers, who often prefer acquiring a single, well-organized entity.

### 3. **Steps to Prepare for Sale**:

   - **Formation of LLC**:
     - Draft an operating agreement that clearly outlines ownership (33.3% for each partner), roles, responsibilities, and decision-making processes (especially related to sale or dissolution).
     - Assign Docket.tv's intellectual property, contracts, and assets to the new LLC.
     - Ensure all IP rights and contracts (with broadcasters or creators) are assigned to this entity to make the sale easier later.

   - **Capitalization and Tax Strategy**:
     - We’ll need to decide how to capitalize the LLC and manage distributions. Make sure to consult with a tax advisor to determine whether the LLC should be taxed as a partnership or elect to be an S-corp/C-corp, depending on our goals.
     - If we plan to attract larger corporations as potential buyers, a C-corp structure might be better for long-term planning, though S-corps may have short-term tax benefits.

   - **Valuation and Financial Metrics**:
     - Begin tracking key business metrics like revenue, user growth, profitability, and customer retention rates. These metrics will heavily influence the valuation when we sell.
     - Consider hiring financial advisors to help with long-term valuation planning.

   - **Legal Documentation**:
     - Draft a **Buy-Sell Agreement** early on. This agreement should outline what happens if one partner wants to sell their shares, how shares will be valued, and how the sale process will unfold.
     - Work with M&A specialists and a tax attorney to ensure our structure is optimized for a sale and to avoid any potential pitfalls during negotiations.

### 4. **Exit Strategy**:
   - Develop a clear exit plan early, even if the sale is several years down the line. Consider whether we’ll be selling the product, shares, or the entire business. A structured LLC allows more flexibility for different sale types (e.g., selling shares or selling the entire entity as a business).
   - Explore potential acquirers in advance, and consider networking with buyers in our industry (media tech, broadcasting) early on.

### Conclusion:
An LLC is likely the best approach, providing a clean structure, protecting personal assets, and allowing for easy transfer of ownership during a sale. It simplifies tax, IP, and asset management, making it easier for potential buyers to acquire the business.

By preparing a clear operating agreement, assigning IP, tracking key metrics, and building an exit strategy, we will position Docket.tv for a smooth sale down the road.
