2. Content Submission
    - Enhancing the Producer Submission Process
        - **Context**
            - Currently replicating the existing Google form.
            - Producers have limited control over scheduling.
            - Goal: Improve the submission process and give producers some scheduling insights.
        - **Proposal**
            - **New Flow for Producers**:
                - Set up the show as its own process.
                - Submit episodes/content under the show.
            - **Scheduling Insights**:
                - Integrate a calendar widget/modal.
                - Allow producers to view available airtime slots.
                - Producers select preferred slots, pending approval from Speak MPLS.
        - **Benefits**
            - Empowers producers by giving them insight into scheduling.
            - Streamlines the submission process.
            - Enhances transparency and planning for producers.
            - Maintains scheduling control for Speak MPLS.
        - **Discussion Points**
            - Feasibility of integrating a real-time calendar widget
                - Easy to implement
            - How the approval process for scheduling would work
                - Broadcasters should be able to override scheduling
                - Scheduling conflicts can be resolved by the Broadcaster
            - Potential challenges and solutions

                **Positive Impacts**:

                1. **Reduced Manual Work**: Automating parts of the submission process could significantly reduce the manual workload for this team member.
                2. **Increased Efficiency**: With a more streamlined process, he could focus on higher-value tasks rather than repetitive data entry.
                3. **Better Accuracy**: Automation reduces the risk of human error in the submission process.

                **Potential Challenges**:

                4. **Role Adjustment**: His role might need to shift to focus more on managing and overseeing the automated system rather than manual submissions.
                5. **Training and Adaptation**: He may need training to understand and adapt to the new system and any new responsibilities that come with it.
