### 1. **LLC (Limited Liability Company):**

- **Pros:**
    - **Flexibility:** LLCs offer flexibility in management and profit distribution. This could be beneficial if the founders want to maintain control over different aspects of the business.
    - **Limited Liability:** Protects personal assets from business debts and liabilities, which is important if [Docket.tv](http://docket.tv/) carries any financial risks.
    - **Tax Benefits:** Profits and losses can pass through to our personal income without facing corporate taxes, avoiding double taxation.
    - **Credibility:** An LLC often adds credibility to a business, which might be important when dealing with partners or clients.
- **Cons:**
    - **Complexity:** Setting up and maintaining an LLC is more complex and costly than a simple partnership.
    - **Self-Employment Taxes:** All profits are subject to self-employment taxes unless we opt for an S-Corp tax designation.
- **Instinct:** Given that [Docket.tv](http://docket.tv/) is a tech-driven platform with potential growth and scaling opportunities, an LLC might offer the right balance of flexibility, protection, and tax efficiency.

### 2. **Joint Venture:**

- **Pros:**
    - **Partnership:** If [Docket.tv](http://docket.tv/) is a collaboration between distinct entities or individuals who may later pursue separate ventures, a joint venture could be a good way to pool resources and expertise without fully merging businesses.
    - **Short-Term Projects:** Ideal for a specific project or for a limited period, which could work if [Docket.tv](http://docket.tv/) is part of a larger strategic goal.
- **Cons:**
    - **Complexity:** Managing a joint venture can be complicated, especially when it comes to profit-sharing, decision-making, and exit strategies.
    - **Limited Longevity:** Typically seen as a temporary arrangement, which might not be ideal if we plan to grow [Docket.tv](http://docket.tv/) into a long-term business.
- **Instinct:** If we and the other founders are considering different paths for the future or have other ventures, a joint venture might be a suitable temporary structure. However, if we're all committed to [Docket.tv](http://docket.tv/) as a long-term business, an LLC might be more appropriate.

### 3. **Partnership:**

- **Pros:**
    - **Simplicity:** Easier and cheaper to set up than an LLC. If we're looking to start quickly with minimal initial costs, a partnership might be appealing.
    - **Shared Responsibility:** Easy to structure based on individual contributions, making it clear who is responsible for what.
- **Cons:**
    - **Unlimited Liability:** Partners are personally liable for business debts, which could be risky.
    - **Disagreements:** Without clear agreements, disputes can arise over decision-making and profit-sharing.
- **Instinct:** While a partnership offers simplicity, the lack of liability protection and potential for conflict may make it less suitable for a tech platform like [Docket.tv](http://docket.tv/), especially if we anticipate scaling and attracting investment.

### **Recommendation:**

Given [Docket.tv](http://docket.tv/)’s potential for growth, scalability, and the involvement of multiple founders, forming an **LLC** might be the most strategic choice. It offers the flexibility we might need as we develop the platform, protects personal assets, and can be an attractive structure for investors or partners down the road. If we're planning for significant growth and possibly bringing on additional investors, the LLC structure could later be converted to a corporation if needed.

However, if we’re uncertain about the long-term commitment and want to test the waters with this venture, we could start with a joint venture, keeping the option open to transition to an LLC as the business evolves.
