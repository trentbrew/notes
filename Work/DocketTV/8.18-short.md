4-4:30 CT sounds good on my end! I'm sharing the two topics I'm hoping to get feedback/clarity on.

1. Broadcaster Onboarding / Intake
    - Assess broadcaster info that we're collecting and why
    - Explore Nexudus integration for Auth + Member invitations/onboarding
    - Other PEG organization structure
    - Can producers air their content on multiple channels?
    - Do many other PEG channels operate on a similar membership basis? Is a `broadcaster > produce`r relationship the norm?
2. Content Submission
    - Improve Producer Submission Process
        - New flow: set up show, submit episodes/content
        - Integrate calendar widget for scheduling insights
        - Producers select preferred slots, pending approval
    - Benefits:
        - Empowers producers with scheduling insights
        - Streamlines submission process
        - Enhances transparency and planning
        - Maintains scheduling control for Speak MPLS
    - Discussion Points:
        - Feasibility of real-time calendar widget
        - Approval process for scheduling
        - Potential challenges and solutions
    - Scheduling:
        - What are some of Chaz's most common pain points with the current process?
        - Does Speak MPLS want to retain control over scheduling? What are the implications of giving producers the ability to pick their timeslots / run-schedule?
    - Moderation:
        - Have you had incidents in the past where content was uploaded that violated the terms of service? What was the process for resolving those issues? How would you ideally prevent/improve this process?
    - ---


    4-4:30 CT sounds good on my end 🙏🏾 Thank you both for your patience & understanding. I think 30min should be plenty. I've been working on the onboarding eel free to share any immediate thoughts/insights ahead of our call.
