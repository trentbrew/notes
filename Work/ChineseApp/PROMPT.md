I'm helping a friend with the UI/UX for a chinese learning app he's building.

He's hoping to release the app in June of 2025 (6 months from now).

# Core deliverables:

1. **Brand Identity & Brand Voice**

- Tools: Figma, Canva, Notion
- Goals: The brand identity is the personality, face, and voice of the app. This deliverable will include the name, logo, color palette, typography, copy, and other front-facing elements that may exist beyond the scope of the app itself.

2. **Comprehensive Design System**

- Tools: Figma
- Goals: This ties everything together. It sets the tone for the brand identity, component library, and overall design language. It is the visual language for the app, and the guideline by which all other deliverables are crafted. This includes colors, type, spacing, character design, animation style, art direction, iconography, UI, and more.

3. **UI/UX Mockups & User Journeys**

- Tools: Figma, Figjam
- Goals: The aim of the the UI/UX mockups is not to be pixel perfect, but to be a comprehensive guide for the relationships of the pages/screens and flow of the app. These mockups will inform the process by which the user will interact with the app.

4. **Component Library & Documentation**

- Tools: Flutter, GitHub, GitBook
- Goals: This is a codebase of Flutter components. Each component is a fully functional widget that can be puzzle-pieced together to create a fully functional app. Each component is designed to be used in a way that is consistent with the overall design system and brand identity. Each component includes documentation, tests, and examples.

5. **Illustration & Character Animation**

- Tools: Procreate
- Goals: This is a collection of illustrations and animations that will be used to bring the app to life. This includes a cast of characters that will be used to represent the app in marketing/promotional materials as well as in the app itself. The characters will be designed and animated in a style that is consistent with the overall design system and brand identity.

6. **Landing Page**

- Tools: Figma, Notion
- Goals: This is the first thing users see when they land on the app. It will be the first impression of the app and the brand identity. It's job is to provide the user with a clear understanding of what the app is and why it's valuable. It should be a comprehensive guide for the user to understand the app and its features. The landing page should point the user to the app store, social media, and other relevant links.

7. **Marketing Materials**

- Tools: Figma, Notion
- Goals: This is a collection of marketing materials that will be used to promote the app. This includes social media posts, blog posts, and other marketing materials. This may include adhoc materials for specific events or campaigns.

# The ask

I need you to draft a comprehensive Statement of Work (SOW) for this project. Here is a rough outline for how it could look, but feel free to adjust the structure based on your intuition regarding what would be the most important/neccessary information to include. After completing the SOW, please provide a separate document reflecting upon and breaking down your decision-making process behind your draft.
