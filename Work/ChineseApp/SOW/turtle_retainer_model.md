Below is a high-level example of how you can translate a **Design Joy–style subscription model** to full-service **product design & software development**, using **Linear** for issue tracking/project management, **Slack** for communication, and **Stripe** for subscription billing.

---

## **1. Overview of the Model**

1. **Monthly Subscription**

   - Clients pay a fixed monthly fee via **Stripe** to get access to on-demand product design and software development services.
   - Emphasize the “unlimited requests” concept, but with clear **concurrency limits** (e.g., 1 or 2 active tasks at a time).

2. **Queue + Turnaround**

   - All requests are managed in **Linear**, where each request becomes an issue or task.
   - The team works on requests in order of priority. Smaller tasks can have a quick (e.g., 48–72 hours) turnaround, while bigger features or sprints take longer, all tracked transparently in Linear.

3. **Slack Communication**

   - Every subscription comes with a dedicated Slack channel or Slack Connect link.
   - Clients can quickly ask questions, review deliverables, and get updates.
   - Real-time chat fosters a sense of partnership, just as with a typical design subscription but expanded to dev work.

4. **Value Proposition**
   - Clients get continuous design + development output without the overhead of building an internal team or juggling multiple freelancers.
   - Predictable budgeting, consistent communication, and faster turnarounds compared to ad-hoc contracting.

## **2. Service Scope & Concurrency**

### **Unlimited Requests (with Concurrency Limits)**

- **Unlimited requests**: Clients can add as many tickets in Linear as they want, but only a set number of tasks (e.g., 1 or 2) can be “active” at any given time.
- **Task Prioritization**: Clients drag tasks to the top of the backlog or “To Do” column to indicate what they need next.

### **Task Categories**

1. **Design Tasks**

   - UI/UX wireframes, prototypes
   - Branding & visual assets
   - Illustrations, animations, marketing collateral
   - User flow audits and improvements

2. **Development Tasks**

   - Frontend (web/mobile) in chosen frameworks (e.g., React, Flutter)
   - Backend & APIs (Node.js, Python, etc.)
   - DevOps & infrastructure (CI/CD, server config, containerization)
   - Maintenance and bug fixes

3. **Consulting/Strategy**
   - Product roadmaps, architecture planning
   - User experience consulting
   - Technical audits & recommendations

**Turnaround Expectations**

- **Simple tasks** (e.g., minor UI tweaks) can be done in ~48 hours.
- **Moderate tasks** (e.g., a new landing page) may take a few days to a week.
- **Large tasks** (e.g., building a new feature or refactoring an entire API) can be broken into sprints, each lasting 1–2 weeks or more.

## **3. Workflow Breakdown**

1. **Client Onboarding (via Stripe)**

   - The client selects a subscription tier (e.g., 1 active task vs. 2 active tasks) and sets up recurring billing through **Stripe**.
   - Once payment is confirmed, you provision their **Slack** access and **Linear** workspace.

2. **Task Submission (via Linear)**

   - The client creates a ticket in Linear with relevant details (requirements, references, deadlines).
   - Labels or custom fields can indicate whether it’s design-related, development-related, or both.

3. **Prioritization & Scheduling**

   - The client or your team updates the backlog.
   - Active tasks move into “In Progress”—limited by the concurrency cap.
   - If tasks exceed available “Active” slots, they stay in the queue until an active task is completed.

4. **Communication & Iteration (Slack)**

   - Real-time messaging in Slack keeps feedback loops quick.
   - For design tasks, share Figma or design previews. For dev tasks, share staging URLs, screenshots, or Loom videos.
   - Gather feedback, revise, or proceed until the client approves.

5. **Deployment & Handover**
   - Once a feature or design is complete, finalize or deploy.
   - Move the Linear ticket to “Done.”
   - The client can then move another task from the backlog to “Active,” maintaining the unlimited request flow.

## **4. Tiered Plans Example**

Rather than a single monthly fee, you can adapt multiple tiers, similar to how Design Joy offers different concurrency levels:

1. **Plan A: Basic** (\$X/month)

   - **1 active task** at a time
   - Ideal for smaller businesses with moderate design/dev needs
   - Turnaround on small tasks: 3–5 days

2. **Plan B: Pro** (\$Y/month)

   - **2 active tasks** at a time
   - Faster response times, suitable for startups building multiple features in parallel
   - Turnaround on small tasks: 2–3 days

3. **Plan C: Enterprise** (\$Z/month)
   - More concurrent tasks, possibly dedicated Slack channel with near-instant response times, advanced DevOps, priority scheduling
   - Best for companies needing ongoing product iteration or multiple concurrent projects

**Add-ons**

- **On-site workshops**, extended consulting, or specialized services (3D modeling, advanced AI, etc.) can be either included at higher tiers or sold as separate bolt-ons.

## **5. Implementation Details**

### **Using Linear**

- **Private Workspace**: Each client gets their own Linear workspace or project.
- **Issue Templates**: Provide pre-built templates for design vs. development tasks, so the client knows what info to include (requirements, brand guidelines, tech stack, etc.).
- **Custom Fields**: Add fields like “Estimate” or “Complexity” to help gauge turnaround times.

### **Using Slack**

- Create a **Slack Connect** channel or workspace for each client.
- Automate notifications: e.g., when a task in Linear moves to “In Progress” or “Blocked,” Slack sends a notification.
- Keep ephemeral chat in Slack, but store final specs or decisions in the Linear issue for reference.

### **Using Stripe**

- Set up **Stripe Subscriptions**: Clients sign up on your website, pick a plan, and enter their billing info.
- Automatic monthly billing ensures predictable recurring revenue.
- Use Stripe’s built-in customer portal for clients to manage payment methods or upgrade/downgrade plans.

## **6. Key Advantages**

1. **Predictable Revenue & Workflows**
   - Recurring subscriptions stabilize cash flow and let you plan team utilization more accurately.
2. **Transparent Queue & Communication**
   - Linear organizes tasks, Slack provides real-time feedback, reducing friction typical of “scattered” communication channels.
3. **Scalable for Clients**
   - Clients can upgrade if they need more concurrency or heavier workloads (mobile + web + devops simultaneously).
4. **Simple Value Proposition**
   - “One subscription, unlimited requests, you prioritize tasks, we deliver them in a timely, transparent way.”

---

## **7. Potential Pitfalls & Considerations**

- **Defining “Unlimited”**: Communicate that tasks are unlimited in **quantity**, but concurrency is limited to avoid unrealistic workloads.
- **Scope Creep on Larger Features**: Big tasks (like building an entire new app) must be broken down into smaller tickets.
- **Balancing Demand & Capacity**: If you or your team get overwhelmed, you may need to control the number of new subscribers or scale your workforce.
- **Clear Turnaround SLAs**: Managing client expectations around how soon major features can be delivered is critical—48-hour turnarounds don’t always apply to complex software tasks.

### **Final Thoughts**

A **Design Joy–inspired** monthly subscription model, powered by **Linear, Slack, and Stripe**, can be a compelling approach to offer full-service **product design** and **software development**. It provides:

- **Simplicity**: Single monthly fee, streamlined communication.
- **Transparency**: Clients always see the status of their tasks in Linear, can chat real-time in Slack, and know exactly when their next billing cycle is in Stripe.
- **Scalability**: You can add or remove concurrency tiers as demand grows or if you bring on new team members.

It’s a **modern, productized way** to turn a traditionally ad-hoc or time-based service into a frictionless monthly subscription—much like Design Joy did for design, but **expanded** to the entire product development life cycle.
