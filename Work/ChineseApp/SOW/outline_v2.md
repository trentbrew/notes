1. Initial Discovery & Planning (Plan C: Enterprise Tier)

- Given the complexity and scope, this would require our highest tier
- Multiple concurrent workstreams needed for design, frontend, and backend
- Initial discovery phase to break down requirements into manageable tasks

2. Project Breakdown in Linear:

A. Design Epics:

- UI/UX Research & System Design
- Core Feature Prototypes
- Interactive Components Library
- Accessibility Implementation

B. Development Epics:

- Mobile App Infrastructure (React Native)
- Backend Services (Node.js/GraphQL)
- Database Architecture (PostgreSQL)
- Integration Services (TTS, Dictionary APIs)

3. Implementation Strategy:

Phase 1: Core Foundation (Months 1-2)

- Dictionary/Vocabulary Management
- Basic User Systems
- Database Schema
- Initial UI Components

Phase 2: Key Features (Months 2-4)

- Sentence Authoring System
- Review System Implementation
- Reader Mode Basic Features
- Core Analytics

Phase 3: Advanced Features (Months 4-6)

- Media Integration
- Gamification Systems
- Advanced Analytics
- Community Features Foundation

4. Task Management:

Active Concurrent Tasks (Enterprise Tier):

- Design Track: UI/UX work
- Frontend Track: React Native development
- Backend Track: API and infrastructure
- QA/Testing Track: Continuous testing

5. Communication Structure:

Daily:

- Slack updates on active tasks
- Linear ticket status updates
- Quick feedback cycles for UI/UX decisions

Weekly:

- Sprint planning and review
- Progress demos
- Resource allocation review

6. Deliverable Process:

For Each Feature:

1. Design mockups and prototypes
2. Client review and approval
3. Development implementation
4. Testing and QA
5. Client review and feedback
6. Deployment to staging
7. Final approval and production release

8. Ongoing Maintenance:

- Bug fixes and performance optimization
- Feature enhancements
- Scale infrastructure as needed
- Analytics monitoring and optimization

This project demonstrates why the subscription model works well:

Advantages:

1. Flexible scaling of resources across different project phases
2. Clear communication channels and task tracking
3. Ability to adjust priorities based on testing and feedback
4. Continuous delivery and iteration

Considerations:

1. Need for clear documentation of decisions and technical choices
2. Importance of breaking large features into manageable tasks
3. Balance between concurrent workstreams
4. Regular alignment on priorities and timelines
