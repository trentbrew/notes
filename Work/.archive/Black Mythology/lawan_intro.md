[Connection: The Black Mythology Project]

Hey Stephen,

I'm connecting you with Lawan Alade-Fa, a talented multi-disciplinary designer I've had the pleasure of collaborating with over the past few years.

Lawan and I took some time to chat about The Black Mythology Project in depth, and he's expressed a keen interest in contributing to the project.

I went ahead and set him up on our stack, and just updated the invite next week for the 3 of us to get together and discuss in more detail.

Let me know if next Friday is still a good time, and if there's anything I can support with in preparation for the Nashville Event.

Appreciate you, and excited to keep the ball rolling.

Best,
