Trent,

I wanted to ensure I got these follow-ups to you. Let’s carve out time to discuss them in our next meeting on Friday, August 23rd. Can you host the 90-minute session on Google Meets?

1) Here’s the pitch deck draft for the September 4th event. It should clarify the project’s aims, color schemes for different sections, etc. This is a grant deck I created in February 2024! Although the project has a new name and timeline, its core purposes remain consistent.

2) Attached is the Mundane Afrofuturist Manifesto. I discovered this concept after writing my essay narrative, but my work aligns well with it. The author states, "The imaginative challenge that awaits any Mundane Afrofuturist author who accepts that this is it: Earth is all we have. What will we do with it?" I hope this sense of **responsibility, intentionality, and imagination** will guide our project choices.

3) Here’s the Trello board where all artwork is stored. I’ll ensure we go over how to navigate it next Friday.

4) I’m also building a Pinterest board and will text it to you once it’s ready.

Please remember to invoice me! We initially agreed on $1,000 split over two months, but let’s adjust it to $1,200 split over three months ($400 x 3), if that works for you. Your thoughtfulness and intentionality will greatly enhance the project. I’m truly grateful to have you on board!

All Love,

Hey Stephen,

Thanks again for your time yesterday. I’m really grateful to have met you and to learn more about the project and its inspiration. Our conversation was incredibly insightful, and I feel aligned with the overall vision. I wish I had recorded it—there was so much valuable information to sift through. I captured as much as I could and am excited to review the materials you sent over and dive into the details.

I’m happy to host our weekly meetings. I've sent a calendar invite for 12pm CT / 10am PT, but let me know if another time works better for you.

Regarding the invoicing, I appreciate the adjustment to $1,200 over three months. That works for me, and the extra time will be really helpful. You can find the invoice link here: Trent Brew (stripe.com). It's the same system I use for my retainer clients, so payments will be automatic each month. Let me know if that works for you.

I’m really looking forward to collaborating! If there’s anything else you need before our next meeting, just let me know.

– Trent
