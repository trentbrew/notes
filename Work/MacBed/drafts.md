## Draft 1

Hi Curtis,

I wanted to thank you for taking the time to show my parents and me around Closed Loop Engineering this past Saturday. Getting to see your facility and learn about your work in custom PCBs, 3D printing, and laser cutting was truly inspiring. As someone passionate about engineering and manufacturing, it was exciting to see these processes firsthand.

I particularly enjoyed our discussion about product development and manufacturing. Your insights were invaluable, especially as I've been exploring ways to bridge the gap between software and hardware development.

A bit about me - I'm a software developer and designer who runs Turtle Labs LLC, focusing on creating intuitive digital solutions. While my background is primarily in software, I'm eager to expand into hardware development and manufacturing. Your expertise in this area is exactly the kind of knowledge I'm looking to learn from.

I'd love to explore potential collaboration opportunities where we could combine Closed Loop's hardware expertise with Turtle Labs' software capabilities. Whether it's consulting on software projects or discussing product development ideas, I believe there could be some interesting synergies between our companies.

Please feel free to reach out if you'd ever like to discuss potential projects or if there are ways I could contribute to any of your software needs. You can find my portfolio and more information about my work at [trentbrew.com](https://trentbrew.com).

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your knowledge. I look forward to potentially working together in the future.

Best regards,
Trent
