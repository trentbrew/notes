# Context

My father and I recently toured an engineering/manufacturing facility in LA called [Closed Loop Engineering](https://closedloopengr.com/). It was a really cool experience and I learned a lot. The company is run by a gentleman called [Curtis Young](@/people/curtis-young).

## How did Curtis and my father meet?

Curtis and my father recently met at a program called [EMI: Economic Mobility Initiative](https://www.lacountyemi.com/), a collaborative for business owners, entrepreneurs, and social enterprises. EMI provides a coordinated and customized approach across 15+ local partners to ensure you have access to all programs, services, and resources to not only start-up and grow, but advance economic mobility, build resiliency and generational wealth, and close the gender and racial wealth gap.

Curtis has an engineering background and my father has a background in business. During the program Curtis and my father met and made a connection.

## How did I meet Curtis?

Curtis invited my father to tour the facility and I joined him. My father had mentioned that I was interested in engineering and manufacturing, so Curtis invited me to join as well. We spent the this past Saturday afternoon touring the facility and learning about the company. It was a really cool experience and I learned a lot.

During the tour Curtis showed me how they do custom PCBs, 3D printing, and laser cutting. It was really insightful and inspiring. It was also serendipitous because I've been thinking a lot about how I can get more involved in manufacturing and engineering, as I've been sketching out a few ideas for products that I'd like to build but I had no idea how to get started.

## Product Ideas

For a while, my 2020 MacBook Air has been my primary laptop. It's been a great machine, but after a while I've realized that 16gb of RAM and 256gb of storage is not enough for my needs. I would love to upgrade the internals myself but Apple laptops are notoriously difficult to repair and upgrade. I didn't want to pay for a new laptop and the only issue I have with my current one is the RAM and storage.

I tried external hard drives (HDD), but they were slow, unreliable, and it was annoying to have to plug them in and out. It wasn't easy to use them on the go, and I didn't like the idea of having to carry around a bunch of external hardware.

I spent some time researching and looking for a product that would solve this problem. What I wanted was a kind of indiscernible dock that lives with my laptop and provides additional storage, power, ports, battery, and maybe more. Based on my research, a product like this doesn't exist, and I think it would be a really cool and product to build.

I discussed this idea with Curtis during our tour and he seems interested in exploring it further. I've never built a product before, but I think it would be a really neat experience and I'm interested in learning more about the process. I'm hoping to share a comprehensive plan with Curtis and see if he'd be interested in working together to make this idea a reality, but before I do that I wanted to reach out to him and say thank you for the tour and for the opportunity to learn more about Closed Loop Engineering. I also want to share my contact information, website, and a little bit about my background with him in case he'd like to reach out about collaborating on anything in the future be it software or anything else. I want to open the door for collaboration and I want to position myself as the go-to designer / developer for any future software projects.

Above all, I want to enter the space as a student and learn as much as I can. I'm not looking to make a quick buck, but I'm also not looking to work for free. I'm hoping to find a collaborative partner who is willing to mentor me and teach me the ropes of the industry. I'm hoping to find a partner who is willing to invest in me and my ideas and help me bring them to life.

## Turtle Labs LLC

Turtle Labs LLC is my company that I do business as. I imagine this product would be a partnership between Closed Loop Engineering and Turtle Labs. I like the idea of having a hardware partner. I hope Closed Loop and Turtle Labs can work together in the future. I want this email to be the first step in that collaboration.

Hi Curtis,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to thank you for the opportunity to tour Closed Loop Engineering this past Saturday. It was such a cool experience, and I‚Äôm grateful for the chance to see your work firsthand.

The visit really sparked my curiosity about engineering and manufacturing. I‚Äôm eager to explore how my skills as a designer and developer might intersect with the kinds of innovative work you‚Äôre doing.

By way of introduction, I co-run a small software shop with my father called Turtle Labs LLC, where we focus on design-centric web and mobile applications. While our website is still under construction, you can find more about my background & work at my personal website: trentbrew.com.

I‚Äôd love to stay connected and keep the door open for potential collaboration, whether through software development, creative problem-solving, or even in exploring how to bridge the gap between software and hardware. I‚Äôm also eager to deepen my understanding of the manufacturing process and learn what it takes to bring a product to market.

Thank you again for taking the time to share your expertise and your space with us. If there‚Äôs ever an opportunity to connect further, I‚Äôd be happy to support in any way I can. My contact information can be found below:
