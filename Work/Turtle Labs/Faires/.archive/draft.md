# **Goals & Objectives**

---

Faires A. Sekiya is a seasoned cinematographer with over two decades of experience across diverse film projects. Despite his breadth of skills and industry credits, he currently lacks a unified online presence to showcase his work, connect with prospective collaborators, and highlight his unique artistry. These gaps make it harder for clients, producers, and fans to fully grasp his expertise at a glance.

To address these challenges, **Turtle Labs** aims to:

- Create a visually compelling, easy-to-navigate website that spotlights Faires’s most impactful reel footage and credits.
- Incorporate strategic SEO and social media initiatives to broaden his digital footprint and drive more potential leads.
- Position Faires as a trusted, veteran voice in the industry—reinforcing his longstanding reputation while modernizing his online brand presence.

Through this plan, we will deliver an end-to-end solution that melds Faires’s impressive tenure with a fresh, audience-friendly digital platform.

# **SEO, Social Media, and Analytics**

---

## **SEO & Analytics Overview**

### **1. Why SEO Matters for a Cinematographer’s Site**

- **Visibility & Credibility**
  When potential collaborators or producers Google your name or relevant terms (e.g., “Chicago steadicam operator,” “veteran camera operator”), strong search rankings help them find you—reinforcing your professional reputation.
- **Targeted Keywords**
  Focusing on specific industry phrases (e.g., “cinematographer with 20+ years’ experience,” “feature film camera operator”) ensures you reach the right audience. This is especially beneficial given your wide range of skills and impressive credits.
- **Backlinks & Referrals**
  Linking to and from platforms like IMDb, press mentions, and festival pages will boost your domain authority. Consistent cross-referencing helps search engines see you as a credible figure in the field.

### **2. On-Page SEO Essentials**

- **Meta Tags & Descriptions**
  Framer lets you customize page titles, meta descriptions, and Open Graph data—ensuring that search engines and social media platforms display concise, keyword-rich summaries of each page.
- **Structured Content**
  Highlight your filmography, awards, and skill sets on dedicated pages so search engines can easily parse the information. We can also incorporate schema markup for creative professionals to further enhance search visibility.
- **Image & Video Optimization**
  Adding alt text to still frames and properly labeling your reels (e.g., “Cinematography Reel – Faires Anderson”) helps search engines better understand and index visual media.

### **3. Leveraging Framer’s SEO Tools**

- **Custom Domains & SSL**
  Connecting your domain (faires.film) in Framer ensures a secure, professional URL—vital for SEO trust signals.
- **Built-In Meta Editing**
  Framer’s interface makes it easy to add titles, descriptions, and social share images for each page without needing extra plugins.
- **Performance & Responsive Layouts**
  Fast-loading, mobile-friendly experiences are crucial to SEO. Framer’s modern layout engine inherently supports responsive design and optimized loading times.

### **4. Analytics & Ongoing Optimization**

- **Google Analytics / GA4**
  Integrate Google Analytics (or an alternative) directly within Framer to track visits, geographic data, bounce rate, and referral sources—letting us see how people find and interact with your site.
- **User Behavior Insights**
  Understanding which pages (e.g., your reel or credits) get the most views helps us refine content layout and calls-to-action.
- **Continuous Tweaks**
  As you build new credits and reel updates, we’ll adjust meta tags and link structures to stay current with new work and maintain SEO momentum.

### **5. Recommended Next Steps**

1. **Keyword Brainstorm**: Identify the core phrases you want to rank for (e.g., “Steadicam operator for TV & Film,” “Chicago-based cinematographer,” etc.).
2. **Backlink Strategy**: Reach out to film blogs, industry partners, or festival sites to link back to your portfolio.
3. **Monitor & Refine**: Review analytics monthly or quarterly, then make content updates and link-building efforts as needed.

**In short**, SEO ensures your extensive experience and unique skill set are discoverable by the people who matter—directors, producers, and industry peers. With Framer’s built-in SEO features and robust analytics, we’ll create a polished, high-performance site that both _looks_ and _ranks_ the part.

## **Social Media Management (Optional Add-On)**

### **1. Why Social Media Matters for a Veteran Cinematographer**

- **Build Credibility & Reach**
  Even a simple Instagram feed or LinkedIn profile can become a quick “lookbook” for potential collaborators. It reinforces your online presence beyond just a standalone site or IMDb page.
- **Strengthen SEO**
  Search engines give credence to cross-linked, active social profiles. Sharing new reels or behind-the-scenes posts can drive traffic back to your site, improving search visibility.
- **Showcase Personality & Experience**
  After two decades in the industry, your behind-the-scenes stories, set photos, or quick insights can spark interest. Social media offers a channel to reveal the “real person” behind the camera.

### **2. Fully-Managed Approach**

1. **Profile Setup & Branding**

   - We’ll create or optimize your accounts (e.g., Instagram, LinkedIn, Vimeo/YouTube) with a consistent visual brand, bio, and contact info.
   - All credentials and ownership stay with you—our role is to maintain and update them.

2. **Content Calendar & Strategy**

   - We’ll plan monthly or weekly posts highlighting key credits, short reel snippets, and on-set anecdotes.
   - This calendar is shared with you for approvals or edits, so you’re always comfortable with what’s being published.

3. **Content Creation & Curation**

   - We pull from your existing footage, stills, or new “quick tips” to craft engaging posts.
   - Where needed, we’ll design graphics or create short, social-friendly teasers from your reel footage.

4. **Engagement & Audience Growth**

   - We respond to basic inquiries or DMs, keeping you in the loop if deeper conversations arise.
   - We can strategically follow or interact with relevant film accounts, festivals, or production studios to grow your network.

5. **Analytics & Reporting**
   - Track followers, engagement rates, and clicks back to your website.
   - Provide monthly recaps so you can see which content resonates and refine strategies accordingly.

### **3. Tailored to 20+ Years of Industry Experience**

- **Highlight Classic Techniques**
  Share short posts or reels that demonstrate “tried-and-true” cinematography methods versus newer experimental trends.

  - E.g., a mini-breakdown of how you overcame a challenging lighting setup using time-tested approaches.

- **Behind-the-Scenes Nuggets**
  With such a lengthy career, you have anecdotes from set mishaps to surprising improvisations—these can be turned into quick, impactful posts that illustrate your reliability and depth of knowledge.

- **Selective Engagement**
  If you prefer minimal interaction, we can keep it purely as a professional portfolio feed rather than a day-to-day personal presence. You can set the tone and level of direct interaction.

### **4. Proposed Deliverables**

1. **Account Creation/Optimization** (Instagram, LinkedIn, Vimeo/YouTube, etc.)
2. **Monthly Content Calendar** (1–3 posts/week, depending on your preference)
3. **Content Design & Scheduling** (carousels, short videos, still frames)
4. **Community Management** (light engagement, DM triage, comment monitoring)
5. **Monthly Analytics Report** (growth, top-performing posts, next steps)

### **5. Next Steps If Interested**

- We’ll hold a brief “Social Brainstorm” call to define your comfort level, content themes, and brand voice.
- Decide which platforms align best with your goals (Instagram for visuals, LinkedIn for networking, Vimeo/YouTube for reel hosting).
- Once approved, we’ll integrate this service into your monthly subscription or retainer for ongoing management.

**In short**, a managed social media presence complements your site’s SEO efforts and showcases the depth of your experience—without adding to your workload. It’s an effective way to stay on the radar of directors, producers, and industry peers who might otherwise never stumble upon your website.
