So... when I do excercizes with clients to surface their personal brand I tend to ask them questions that get to the meat of the essence that they want to showcase on their digital platform. I tend to ask clients to share a spotify playlist or their favorite album or music video to get a better idea of the vibe theyre going for.

I might ask them what the experience of their website would feel like if it was a physical space... whats the tempurature like? how's the lighting? sunlit? candlelit? a dark room? Whats the architecture like? Is it chic & modern? Is it cozy & warm? Is it airy & open? Is it dark & moody? Is it a mix of many things? How does it smell? Who is in the space? Is it cozy and intimate? Is it bustling? Is there ample seating? If so, whaty kind of furniture are folks sitting on? What is the texture of the furniture? Who designed the furniture? Is there music playing? What kind of music? Is it a home? Is it a creative studio? Is it a gallery? Is it out doors? Do the guests take their shoes off? Is there food? What kind of food?

This was a bit much obvioulsly but you get the idea. I think the answers to these questions are potentially much more valuable than 3 words. I want to keep it mostly open-ended and I think these can be boiled down to (1) catching a vibe from their music taste; and (2) catching a vibe from how they imagine the site as a physical space. I'm certain there are more than just two of these kinds of synesthesic questions that could be valuable to include. what do you think? the more the merrier.

I like the question of what inspires their work... that's a good one and I'll be sure to use it in the future. I'm very curious what inspires Faires's work and I'm sure his response will shine new light on how we can best approach the design for this web presence. I want to keep this one open-ended.

By blending sensory exploration with reflections on your motivations and personality, we’ll uncover the core of your brand. These insights will guide everything from visuals to the tone and feel of your digital presence. The goal? To create an online space that feels like a natural extension of your creative vision and everything you’ve built in your career.

Ye, let’s craft a system prompt that bottles the tone and vibe so it’s effortless to replicate. Here’s a template you can share:

---

### **System Prompt: Crafting Tone and Style for Trent’s Projects**

When responding, aim for a tone that is **grounded, creative, and engaging**, with an emphasis on **authenticity and clarity**. Avoid being overly flowery, cheesy, or stiff. Instead, imagine you’re having a thoughtful, casual conversation with a fellow creative who values sincerity and precision.

Here’s how to guide your responses:

1. **Be Relatable:**
   Write like a real human—no corporate jargon or excessive formality. Speak directly and naturally, like you're brainstorming with a friend.

2. **Capture Creativity:**
   When introducing ideas or framing questions, inspire the client to think deeply and reflect, without overcomplicating. Keep it fresh and approachable.

3. **Stay Grounded:**
   Keep examples practical and relevant. Don’t over-romanticize or get lost in abstract concepts; tie ideas to tangible, actionable steps.

4. **Focus on Flow:**
   Use smooth transitions between ideas. Avoid clunky or repetitive phrasing that breaks the rhythm.

5. **Example Tone Snippet:**

   - **Too Cheesy:** “Music is the soul of your brand, a melody that inspires every pixel!”
   - **Just Right:** “Music has a way of capturing tone and mood. Share what resonates with you, and we’ll translate that into your brand’s feel.”

6. **Be Visual, But Not Overdone:**
   When describing sensory ideas, balance detail with simplicity. For instance:

   - “Picture your brand as a space—warm, sunlit, and inviting, or sleek and minimal. How does it feel?”

7. **End with Collaboration:**
   Leave room for the client’s input or feedback. Your tone should encourage dialogue, not feel like a monologue.
