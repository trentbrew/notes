## 2. OWNERSHIP AND LICENSES

### 2.1 Client Owns All Work Product

As part of this job, the Contractor is creating "work product" for the Client. To avoid confusion, "work product" includes:

- The website design and codebase
- Custom graphics and visual elements
- Content strategy documents
- SEO implementations
- Analytics configurations
- Social media templates and strategies

The Contractor hereby gives the Client this work product once the Client pays for it in full. This means the Contractor is giving the Client all rights, titles, and interests in and to the work product (including intellectual property rights), and the Client will be the sole owner of it. The Client can use the work product however they want or they can decide not to use the work product at all.

### 2.2 Contractor's Use Of Work Product

Once the Contractor gives the work product to the Client, the Contractor may only:

1. Use screenshots or recordings of the public-facing website in their portfolio
2. Reference the project in their client list and marketing materials
3. Share non-confidential technical details about the implementation

The Contractor may not:

1. Reuse custom design elements created specifically for the Client
2. Share or reuse any of the Client's cinematography work or related assets
3. Disclose any non-public information about the Client's business or projects

### 2.3 Contractor's Help Securing Ownership

In the future, the Client may need the Contractor's help to show that the Client owns the work product or to complete the transfer. The Contractor agrees to help with that. For example, the Contractor may have to sign a patent application. The Client will pay any required expenses for this. If the Client can't find the Contractor, the Contractor agrees that the Client can act on the Contractor's behalf to accomplish the same thing. The following language gives the Client that right: if the Client can't find the Contractor after spending reasonable effort trying to do so (see section 11.4 Notices), the Contractor hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Client as the Contractor's agent and attorney-in-fact, which appointment is coupled with an interest, to act for the Contractor and on the Contractor's behalf to execute, verify, and file the required documents and to take any other legal action to accomplish the purposes of paragraph 2.1 (Client Owns All Work Product).

### 2.4 Contractor's IP That Is Not Work Product

During this project, the Contractor might use:

- Framer development platform
- Analytics tools and scripts
- SEO optimization tools
- Social media management tools
- Standard web development frameworks and libraries
- Design tools and software

This "background IP" remains the property of the Contractor or its respective owners. The Client receives a perpetual, non-exclusive license to use these tools as part of the delivered website, but cannot extract or reuse them separately.

### 2.5 Contractor's Right To Use Client IP

The Client grants the Contractor limited rights to use:

- The Client's name and professional title
- Public cinematography reels and credits
- Publicly available photos and media
- Professional biography and credentials

This use is strictly limited to implementing the website and related marketing materials. The Contractor may not use these assets for any other purpose without written permission.

## 3. COMPETITIVE ENGAGEMENTS

The Contractor won't work for a competitor of the Client until this Contract ends. To avoid confusion, a competitor is any third party that plans to or actively develops, manufactures, promotes, sells, licenses, distributes, or provides products or services whose project scopes are substantially similar to the scope of the Client's products or services. The one exception to this restriction is if the Contractor asks for permission beforehand and the Client agrees to it in writing. If the Contractor uses employees or subcontractors, the Contractor must make sure they follow the obligations in this paragraph, as well.

## 4. NON-SOLICITATION

Until this Contract ends, the Contractor won't:

- encourage Client employees or service providers to stop working for the Client;
- encourage Client customers or clients to stop doing business with the Client
- hire anyone who worked for the Client over the 12-month period before the Contract ended.

The one exception is if the Contractor puts out a general ad and someone who happened to work for the Client responds. In that case, the Contractor may hire that candidate. The Contractor promises that it won't do anything in this paragraph on behalf of itself or a third party.

## 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

Neither party is liable for breach-of-contract damages that the breaching party could not reasonably have foreseen when it entered this Contract.

## 10. INDEMNITY

### 10.1 Overview

This section transfers certain risks between the parties if a third party sues or goes after the Client or the Contractor or both.

## 11. GENERAL

### 11.1 Assignment

This Contract applies only to the Client and the Contractor. The Contractor cannot assign their rights or delegate their obligations under this Contract to a third-party (other than by will or intestate), without first receiving the Client's written permission. In contrast, the Client may assign their rights and delegate its obligations under this Contract without the Contractor's permission. This is necessary in case, for example, another Client buys out the Client or if the Client decides to sell the work product that results from this Contract.

### 11.2 Arbitration

As the exclusive means of initiating adversarial proceedings to resolve any dispute arising under this Contract, a party may demand that the dispute be resolved by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its commercial arbitration rules.

### 11.3 Modification; Waiver

To change anything in this Contract, the Client and the Contractor must agree to that change in writing and sign a document showing their contract. Neither party can waive its rights under this Contract or release the other party from its obligations under this Contract, unless the waiving party acknowledges it is doing so in writing and signs a document that says so.

### 11.4 Notices

(a) Notices must be in writing and delivered via:

- Email to:
  - Client: faires@earthlink.net
  - Contractor: hello@trentbrew.com
- Physical mail to addresses provided separately
- Personal delivery to authorized representatives

(b) The timing of when a notice is received can be very important. To avoid confusion, a valid notice is considered received as follows:

1. if delivered personally, it is considered received immediately.
2. if delivered by email, it is considered received upon acknowledgement of receipt.
3. if delivered by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested), it is considered received upon receipt as indicated by the date on the signed receipt. If a party refuses to accept notice or if notice cannot be delivered because of a change in address for which no notice was given, then it is considered received when the notice is rejected or unable to be delivered. If the notice is received after 5:00pm on a business day at the location specified in the address for that party, or on a day that is not a business day, then the notice is considered received at 9:00am on the next business day.

### 11.5 Severability

This section deals with what happens if a portion of the Contract is found to be unenforceable. If that's the case, the unenforceable portion will be changed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, unless that change is not permitted by law, in which case the portion will be disregarded. If any portion of the Contract is changed or disregarded because it is unenforceable, the rest of the Contract is still enforceable.

### 11.6 Signatures
