## Social Media Management & Strategy

### Why Social Media Matters for a Veteran Cinematographer

- **Build Credibility & Reach**
  Even a simple Instagram feed or LinkedIn profile can become a quick "lookbook" for potential collaborators. It reinforces your online presence beyond just a standalone site or IMDb page.
- **Strengthen SEO**
  Search engines give credence to cross-linked, active social profiles. Sharing new reels or behind-the-scenes posts can drive traffic back to your site, improving search visibility.
- **Showcase Personality & Experience**
  After two decades in the industry, your behind-the-scenes stories, set photos, or quick insights can spark interest. Social media offers a channel to reveal the "real person" behind the camera.

### Fully-Managed Approach

1. **Profile Setup & Branding**
   - We'll create or optimize your accounts (e.g., Instagram, LinkedIn, Vimeo/YouTube) with a consistent visual brand, bio, and contact info.
   - All credentials and ownership stay with you—our role is to maintain and update them.
2. **Content Calendar & Strategy**
   - We'll plan monthly or weekly posts highlighting key credits, short reel snippets, and on-set anecdotes.
   - This calendar is shared with you for approvals or edits, so you're always comfortable with what's being published.
3. **Content Creation & Curation**
   - We pull from your existing footage, stills, or new "quick tips" to craft engaging posts.
   - Where needed, we'll design graphics or create short, social-friendly teasers from your reel footage.
4. **Engagement & Audience Growth**
   - We respond to basic inquiries or DMs, keeping you in the loop if deeper conversations arise.
   - We can strategically follow or interact with relevant film accounts, festivals, or production studios to grow your network.
5. **Analytics & Reporting**
   - Track followers, engagement rates, and clicks back to your website.
   - Provide monthly recaps so you can see which content resonates and refine strategies accordingly.

### Tailored to 20+ Years of Industry Experience

- **Highlight Classic Techniques**
  Share short posts or reels that demonstrate "tried-and-true" cinematography methods versus newer experimental trends. - E.g., a mini-breakdown of how you overcame a challenging lighting setup using time-tested approaches.
- **Behind-the-Scenes Nuggets**
  With such a lengthy career, you have anecdotes from set mishaps to surprising improvisations—these can be turned into quick, impactful posts that illustrate your reliability and depth of knowledge.
- **Selective Engagement**
  If you prefer minimal interaction, we can keep it purely as a professional portfolio feed rather than a day-to-day personal presence. You can set the tone and level of direct interaction.

### Deliverables

1. **Account Creation/Optimization** (Instagram, LinkedIn, Vimeo/YouTube, etc.)
2. **Monthly Content Calendar** (1–3 posts/week, depending on your preference)
3. **Content Design & Scheduling** (carousels, short videos, still frames)
4. **Community Management** (light engagement, DM triage, comment monitoring)
5. **Monthly Analytics Report** (growth, top-performing posts, next steps)
