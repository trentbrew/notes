# Context

---

  - Established: 2022
  - Primary contact: Trenton Brew, Founder
  - Core capabilities: Web Development, Mobile Development, AI/ML Integration, UI/UX Design, Graphic Design, Branding, Marketing
  - Primary audience: Startups and small businesses in the United States

### Telos Affinity Group LLC (TAG)

- Telos
  - Established: 2024
  - Primary contact: Derrick Brew, Founder

  - Primary audience: Government Entities in California
  - Website: https://tag.us.com

### The Problem

Telos Affinity Group (TAG) serves California government entities in two capacities: as both a consulting firm and a software development company. This dual role presents several challenges:

- **Conflict of Interest**: TAG's position as both consultant and software developer may lead to biased recommendations, misuse of confidential information, and prioritization of self-interest over client needs.
- **Operational Inefficiency**: The overlap in services and client base results in resource duplication and inefficient processes.
- **Brand Confusion**: TAG's dual identity can cause confusion among clients and stakeholders, potentially damaging the company's reputation and credibility.

### The Solution

In 2025, Turtle Labs LLC will be undergoing a strategic restructuring to better position the company for growth and success. 

# Breakdown

---

### 1. **Purpose of Restructuring**

- **Clarify Objectives**: What is the main driver—e.g., tax optimization, attracting investment, liability protection, or operational efficiency?

    >
    >
- **New Structure Goals**: Consider whether you’re looking to reorganize leadership, add members, establish a parent-subsidiary relationship, or change the LLC’s tax treatment.

    >
    >

---

### 2. **Leadership and Ownership**

- **Management Model**: Decide between member-managed vs. manager-managed LLC based on complexity.

    >
    >
- **Role Clarity**: Clearly outline roles, responsibilities, and authorities of new and existing members or managers.

    >
    >
- **Updating Agreements**: Revise your Operating Agreement to reflect any ownership or leadership changes.

    >
    >

---

### 3. **Tax and Legal Compliance**

- **Tax Status**: If changing from partnership taxation, consider whether electing S-corp or C-corp status better aligns with your goals (e.g., reducing self-employment tax or raising capital).

    >
    >
- **State Filings**: Ensure the Illinois Secretary of State is notified of structural changes (Articles of Amendment).

    >
    >
- **Document Consistency**: Reflect changes across Articles of Organization, Operating Agreement, and tax filings.

    >
    >

---

### 4. **Investment or Subsidiary Considerations**

- **Subsidiary Formation**: If expanding operations, consider forming subsidiaries for liability segregation.

    >
    >
- **Outside Investors**: If inviting external investors, ensure membership interests and voting rights are clearly defined.

    >
    >

---

### 5. **Next Steps**

- Draft a **Restructuring Plan** detailing new management roles, ownership changes, and operational adjustments.

    >
    >
- File amendments to legal documents (Articles of Amendment, Operating Agreement).

    >
    >
- Communicate changes internally and externally (e.g., vendors, customers, investors).
