That's what I'm trying to figure out... Telos is my father's company. Turtle is mine. I've been running Turtle for a few years but it's mostly been a medium through which I invoice my freelance clients. It has a fully fleshed out brand identity, accounts recievable over the past few years, somewhat of a fine reputation, an intern potentially coming on board in a few months, and is in good standing mostly.

Telos is a younger company, a couple of months old. My father started Telos to take advantage of government contracting setaside opportinities as he has both black-owned business certification and disabled veteran certification. My father has 100% ownership in Telos, we have been submitting bids for software opportunities with no luck so far. We bleive (and our advisor believes) that our service offerings are too dilute. My father goes to a lot of networking events and has mentioned that it can be difficult to discuss the business with some folks because he is not on the technical side, and it can confuse customers if we're offering too many services.

For your reference here are our NAICS:

531210, 711130, 541611, 611430, 611420, 523930, 524210, 561422, 813319, 561720, 541613, 561510, 541910, 541420, 541820, 512290, 541613, 541910, 541511, 621330, 711510, 541519, 515120, 515110, 541715, 238290, 236220, 561920, 423430, 541512.

We have lots of services offerings that have nothing to do with software or design but none of the work we've done thus far with our curent clients has been software. It's mostly been coaching/consulting. My father and I talked about potentially keeping Telos in the space it's in now with mostly non-technical consulting work so that we can rebrand towards something more consistent and cohesive, so I suggested maybe Turtle Labs can be some kind of software arm for Telos, or some kind of partnership that can allow Turtle Labs to be the software brand its always been, and Telos can be the consulting business it's become over the past couple months.

Based on my father and I's conversations my thinking is that Turtle will be the one going and bidding for contracts, and will hire Telos as a consultant on each project that aligns with its capabilities(?). Or maybe we're going all in on Turtle? My father mentioned that if we are going for the same setaside contracts (blackowned+disabledveteran), then he would have to own 51% of Turtle which I'm perfectly fine withâ€“I think I could use help with the administrative/financial/PR aspect of Turtle and I think having my dad on board with real stake in the business would help Turtle get some much needed tending.

These are active discussions atm so I don't have all the answers, but I'd love to hear your thoughts on this conundrum.

I'm here to learn! I have no idea what I'm doing and I'm not sure where to start so my ears and my mind are open!

The outcome I expect from this is:

No more customer confusion

Turtle gets to go for much bigger contracts for
