Hi Lawan and Trent,
I hope you are doing well.

When can we have a meeting to discuss this?
Let me know.

# About Podular:

The client is Jasna Ostojich, founder of Podular Inc. Podular Inc. is an innovative start-up reshaping the Food and beverage stand industry with technology and beautiful design. Podular presents a stylish and personalized modular pod, offering swift and uncomplicated spatial solutions that elevate the customer and employee experience in the food and beverage industry. Founder and Owner Jasna Ostojich aims to empower businesses to excel in operations, engage their customers, reduce third-party order and delivery dependencies, increase operations efficiency and consistency, and fuel overall business growth.

# Client request:

The client has requested for us to assist in the development of a mobile app that will act as an all-in-one platform for her customers to manage their food/drink services. Before we begin designing the app, we've concluded that the client requires marketing & brand strategy as well as a website to promote the app. This has been broken into 3 phases. (1) Marketing & brand strategy <Lawan {Studio LAFA LLC} will handle this part> (2) Mobile app UI/UX <Trent {Turtle Labs LLC} will handle this part> (3) Website design & development <Trent and Lawan will handle this part>.

The client is in the beginnings of the manufacturing process and the timeline for the project is fluid. There are no strict deadlines. With this in mind, Lawan and I have adopted a retainer model for the client which will involve all of the services above on an ongoing basis for $2400 per month as an auto-drafted Stripe subscription through Turtle Labs LLC. Turtle Labs will be invoiced by Studio Lafa LLC each month for $1,200, and Turtle Labs LLC will be paid the remaining $1,200. The client is only making one payment each month.

I've attached the final SOW for your reference.

---

First off, do you think $2,400 is a fair rate for this scope of work? We are stern on this pricing as this project is an undertaking we feel may not be worth our time, but would love to hear your thoughts.

Jasna should be pointed towards the "Full-Service Product Development Package" without being pushy about it.

---

Second, could you please draft an email for Jasna that outlines all this info with concision & brevity?

Attached to the Email will be the following: (1) Scope of Work, (2) Contract, (3) Payment Link.

The email should privde an outlook of the project; noteably, the order of deliverables which is as follows:
1. Marketing & Brand Strategy
2. UX/UI Design for the app
3. Web design & development for promoting the app
