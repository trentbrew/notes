Good morning Gena, I hope you're doing well. Thank you for your patience as I wrap up a few projects before the holidays. I'm excited to get started and I have a draft of your proposal ready, but I wanted to get your thoughts on a possible timeline before I send it over. I'll be moving back to Chicago on December 31st, and will be available to kick off the project on Mon January 8th. I'm happy to start earlier if you'd like, but I wanted to give you a heads up in case you'd prefer to wait until after the holidays. Please let me know your thoughts and I'll send over the updated proposal asap. Thank you again for your patience and I'm looking forward to getting started!
