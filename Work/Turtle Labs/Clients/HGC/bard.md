# Background

I've worked with Gena in the past on the brand identity and logo for Hidden Gems Consulting. Gena reached out to me this past Monday via text to inquire about a website for her new book, and she detailed her vision for the website in our most recent conversation. I'm happy to provide more details on that conversation and the project scope.

# Manifesto as provided by Gena

```md
# **Quote:**

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been really thinking about my content, in terms of how I want to market my services. I must include something about enabling companies to successfully navigate where their purpose intersects with their day-to-day business. Finding and realizing purpose is hot And I great demand right now.‚Äù

# **Clients:**

- **Corporations** (public & private)
- ‚òùüèæ Pivotable & flexible
- Same service pathway for both public and private

# Competitors:

**ie:**

- Baine
- Alix Partners
- PWC
- Deloitte
- McKenzie

**Setting HGC apart:**

- Competitors go in and tell the client what's wrong, they'll write up what they need to do to fix it, and then they leave.
- HGC is offering to go beyond that. HGC is offering to **analyze what's needed**, but also **be with them** as they implement it.
- HGC will consult, share with them their current state, help them **map what their future state needs to be**, and then give them a **roadmap** on how to get there.
- HGC will **come back** (after 6 months or so) and check in post-implementation.
- HGC is a **partnership.**

# **Manifesto**

Hidden Gems Consulting, LLC

- My first operational year will center around building my brand and securing clients. Word of mouth and a website that can be referenced are the primary vehicles for achieving this.
- I see the introduction to me, and my company being delivered in the form of a pitch, whether verbally or through the website. Therefore, the website should be professional, informative, yet concise. The website should be inviting and just different enough so that it is clear that my offerings are a cut above the rest.
- To achieve a cut above the rest vibe, it begins with the **design, and then the content**. Right? You with me here?
- I provide the following consulting services designed to enable clients to achieve their maximum potential:
  - manufacturing operational excellence
    - How?
    - In what ways?
    - Examples/Clients?
  - professional executive coaching
    - How?
    - In what ways?
    - Examples/Clients?
  - cultural (anything else?)
    - How?
    - In what ways?
    - Examples/Clients?
- Okay, my strength (and differentiator!) is the extensive experience I have culled in a series of manufacturing and operations roles spanning 27 years working within signature consumer companies such as Boeing (NYSE: BA), Alcoa (NYSE: AA), and Ford (NYSE: F). I hold multiple degrees including a BA, MBA, MS and expected Ph.D. in December 2021. This combination of my practitioner and scholarly experience makes me uniquely qualified to provide consulting and coaching to clients that will enable sustained transformational results.

Background:

- As a versatile and energetic leader and sponsor-for-change with a successful career as a former c-suite manufacturing operations executive and as a widely respected global diversity, equity, and inclusion chief, I have successfully crafted and led several turnarounds which resulted in sustained business growth, talent management including effectively sourcing diverse talent, increased innovation, operational efficiency, and increased effective employee engagement.
- I have observed through a corporate career spanning over 27 years, that it takes an inordinate amount of time to implement the change that is often necessary for successfully competing in today‚Äôs marketplace. The journey to change has literally felt like sitting at the helm of a huge cruise ship and trying to turn it on a dime. It shouldn‚Äôt be this hard!
- In assessing after action reviews, in each case the key inhibitor for the change companies deem critical is not due to a poor strategy, lack of talent, faulty products and equipment. The culprit in each instance was a condition I refer to as culture entrenchment.
- Culture entrenchment occurs when an organization finds itself with a culture that is out of sync with the agreed upon direction in which the company must head.
- Gena is known for delivering objectives, leading strategic engagement, and innovation, focusing on cultural development, performance improvement, talent alignment, and competitive advantage.
- Gena brings this track record of excellence and visionary leadership to the boardroom and leverages her successful record of community advocacy and consensus building for the broader greater good.
- Her boots-on-the-ground practitioner and scholarship experience enable her to deliver superior customer service to the client.

- I am thinking of adding telephone number for an initial consultation to determine the scope of the engagement and fee.
- My email and cell phone number should also be listed.
  - Company Email (Contact Page)
  - Company Phone Number (Contact Page)
  - Personal Email (About Me)
  - Personal Phone Number (About Me)
  - How much she will be charging for her services
- References‚Ä¶I will list who I have worked with if we think that is a good idea. I‚Äôve only had one client thus far.
- This is a start. Hopefully it provides insight into what I am thinking and we can get this thing kicked off.

# **Website**

1.) E-commerce functionality for users to purchase the book as well as links for 3rd party vendors (Amazon etc)

2.) A booking system similar to Calendly (for prospective HGC clients and users interested in booking speaking engagements etc) + a public calendar/schedule that displays upcoming talks/lectures/events and could allow users to purchase tickets to those events

3.) Video content of your talks/lectures + supplementary articles & blog posts

4.) A group of pages (or perhaps a totally separate site) dedicated to Hidden Gems Consulting with the same branding/logo/visuals as used previously + a similar Calendly booking system, overview of services, testimonials, case studies, contact, etc
```

# Timeline

Kick-off: January 2024 (Ongoing monthly retainer)

# Additional info

- The book is called `C Suite Quotient: The C-Suite Behaviors that Propel Leadership Culture`
- I have a PDF of the book that I can send over to you for reference

I believe Gena is needing 2 sites for 2 domains that she shared with me:
  1. gennalovettc-suitequotient.com (book promotion)
  2. hiddengemsconsulting.com (consulting services)

I'm currently drafting the proposal and will be sending her the contract after the proposal is approved. I could use your help throughout üôèüèæ
