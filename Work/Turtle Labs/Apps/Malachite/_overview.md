# Malachite Overview

A custom E-Commerce solution where clients can manage their products, inventory, orders, customers, etc. I imagine this could scale into a larger platform where smaller/independent sellers can support each other and build communities. I've been in the process of building the backend for this for about a year which integrates Stripe, allowing Gumbo to collect a percentage of each transaction across all stores on the platform.
