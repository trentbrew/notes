## Market Analysis

### Target Market

1. **_Startups:_** Gumbo Media will build custom web, mobile, and desktop applications for early stage start-ups. Startups often have unique technological requirements and a need for innovative software solutions to support their growth and establish a competitive advantage.

- The startup market in 2023 experienced a significant decline in venture funding compared to the previous years. Global startup investment reached $285 billion in 2023, a 38% decrease from the $462 billion invested in 2022. This downturn was observed across all funding stages, with early-stage funding experiencing a reduction of more than 40% year over year. However, it's important to note that despite these cutbacks, the overall funding in 2023 was still less than 20% lower compared to the pre-pandemic years of 2018 to 2020. Additionally, the U.S. venture capital funding amounted to $63 billion in 2023, holding 49% of the total global venture capital funding of $683 billion. In contrast to these trends, AI was one of the few sectors that saw an increase in investment, with global funding to AI startups reaching nearly $50 billion in 2023, up 9% from 2022【12†source】【14†source】.
- In light of these statistics, Gumbo Media's focus on providing affordable development and design services, strategic guidance, and technical expertise to startups becomes even more crucial. As the startup market continues to evolve, Gumbo Media's efforts can play a significant role in supporting startups, particularly those with underrepresented founders. Additionally, considering Black Ambition Prize ([blackambitionprize.com](http://blackambitionprize.com/)) as a potential funding resource can be beneficial, as it offers opportunities and support to Black and Latinx entrepreneurs.
