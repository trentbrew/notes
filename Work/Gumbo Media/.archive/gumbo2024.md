Hi Trent -

I hope you‚Äôve been enjoying this holiday month so far. I wanted to send a quick update on future workstreams for Gumbo. Per some of the updates I‚Äôve recently shared about our need to get more nimble into the new year, we‚Äôll be trimming down most of our services efforts into the hands of a few core folks from the existing team.

If interested, I would love for you to be one of our two primary graphic designer, as well as one of two primary web designers. You‚Äôd be more of a generalist that floats between both capacities. This means you‚Äôd be part of a core 10 or so folks who will be responsible for the bulk of corresponding work coming through our pipeline in the new year. As always, you‚Äôll be a contractor and will still have lots of flexibility to choose whether or not you‚Äôre interested in taking on the proposed work. Our goal is simply to better streamline efficiency and quality control‚Äîand narrowing our core team for services will help build that consistency and familiarity over time. And in that process we‚Äôre prioritizing the folks who are 1) more dependent on the work for sustainability; 2) the folks who have shown a consistent and active commitment to Gumbo‚Äôs clients; and/or 3) have consistently delivered excellent work for our clients.

All other existing contractors within Gumbo who are not part of that core 10 will still be part of Gumbo. But they‚Äôll be extended work more exclusively when 1) our pipeline is too robust for the core; 2) the core team doesn‚Äôt have the time or interest; or 3) when projects are broad enough in scope that it demands it.

If you‚Äôre interested in being more heavily prioritized for future work with Gumbo, please let me know. No immediate rush, as we‚Äôre now in holiday season and won‚Äôt dive back into work until the New Year. But come early January, I hope to have clarity on how to proceed.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Much love.

Hey Matthew,

I'm definitely interested in being more heavily prioritized for future work with Gumbo. I'm happy to be a generalist that floats between graphic/web design, and it's an honor to be considered as one of the primary digital designers :bow::skin-tone-5: I'm happy to contribute in whatever capacity is most helpful to you and the team.

Awesome, thanks, Trent! I have a client asking about the SEO work, so I‚Äôm trying to sort out whether or not it makes sense to take it on now. I‚Äôll give it a think and get back to you, as both you and Cassandra said the same thing.
I‚Äôll be in touch!

Hi Matthew,

Thank you for the holiday wishes and for the updates heading into January. I'm excited to get back into the swing of things and wanted to let you know that I've been doing a ton of research into SEO over the break. I'm feeling much more confident with my understanding of the topic, and I've been working to integrate it into the writing app MVP which I'm excited to share with you soon. Baking SEO into the app has been a great learning experience, and I think I'm in a place where I'm comfortable applying the same model to real-world projects. I'd be happy to continue learning and applying these skills for any clients that are interested in SEO work.

Let me know if there's anything at all I can do to help out this week.

Cheers üôèüèæ

Hi Trent! Happy New Year, brother. I‚Äôm also quite excited for what this year holds.

Thank you for sharing this update with me, and kudos to you for continuing to apply that learning. I will let you know as such projects make themselves available to us so that we can start building a pipeline of that work.

More soon!

Hey Trent! Happy New Year! I have two projects I'd like your help with.
We have a website we have to rebuild for a client. It's called Bronzeville Blues Collaborative, and the lost access to the WordPress site we built a couple of years ago because the client never fully took it on. I offered for Gumbo to rebuild it for them and would love to get that going. We can rebuild it in Webflow, and you can have full creative agency on how you'd like to design it. That said, I have all the base files, content, and core brand ID necessary to frame it up. I want to begin implementing this rather quickly. See details below:
Timeframe: 2 months
Budget: $2,000 (coming out of pocket, not from the client)
Platform: Webflow
I'd like help completing the Gumbo Media website. Hameed has been building it out via Webflow, and we're in the final iteration or so. But I think Hameed has a couple of limitations in design that are strengths for you, and I'd like to comission you to complete it. Details of the process will dictate how we structure this, but we could either complete it in it's current space, or rebuild it per a different vision. I'd love for you to take a look and see what you think. See here for the preview (current issues are completion of some content and then general sizing/spacing/coloring/formatting throughout): https://gumbo-media.webflow.io/old-home
Timeframe: Ideally, also about 2 months.
Budget: Will depend on the route we take. But will be added to the fold of internal work you're doing for Gumbo (The Seed Project, etc.) and will be paid out accordingly.
Platform: Webflow.
Original template: https://gringo-template.webflow.io/home/home-1
Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
