Hey @Matthew, I haven't heard back from Joshua or the Bronzeville Blues team. My last message was quite a lot to digest and I had requested some information from all of the organizations to setup the Zapier so I imagine they are gathering all of that which could take some time. I'll plan to reach out on Thursday since it will have been a full week by then, but lmk if we should reach out sooner.

Regarding Dr. Chapman, I don't have much to report right now but I definitely think a call with her sometime next week would be most helpful for me. I'm eager to get things moving at more of a consistent pace. I think we're still waiting on the photography as well so this feels like a good time to vibe-check with her and gether as much as I can to finialize the visuals & direction.

I also wanted to get your thoughts on what it might look like to have some additional support for the Squarespace build as my bandwidth has been limited. Lawan might be able to help with that â€“ I understand there are moving parts involved in that process so let me know what you think. I would be willing to make adjustments if necessary.

I'll make a note of this to discuss on Thursday but let me know if you have any initial thoughts

The process on my end is a little different, but uploading
