# context

Based on the information shared, Dr. Ashley's role in this situation seems to be primarily as a client who originally engaged with you for freelance web/graphic design services. Here are key points regarding her involvement and say in the matter:

Initial Engagement: Dr. Ashley reached out to you for a long-term freelance arrangement following a successful project completion.

Autonomy in Decision Making: She has autonomy in deciding whether to continue with the revised arrangement of routing her retainer through Gumbo Media. While she initially agreed to your freelance services, she now has the option to accept or decline the new proposal.

Informed Consent: Dr. Ashley should be kept fully informed about any changes in the service provision, pricing, and the scope of work. Her consent is crucial for any new contract or adjustment in the existing agreement.

Consideration of Her Needs: Her needs and preferences, including the scope of work and the budget, are important. The discussion about potentially splitting her scope of work into separate contracts seems to be in response to her specific requirements and budget considerations.

Flexibility and Openness to Changes: It appears that there's some flexibility in the arrangement, and Dr. Ashley's feedback or concerns can potentially influence the final structure of the contract and services provided.

In summary, Dr. Ashley has a significant say in accepting the new arrangement, the scope of services, and the pricing structure. Her approval is essential for moving forward with the transition of her retainer to be managed through Gumbo Media.

Hi Trent –

This is great! Would love to get these going next week. Definitely both in our wheelhouse, and projects we’d be interested in taking on.

I think what’d be helpful is to learn more about where communications on these projects are currently. Have these folks both reached out to you to provide these services already? Or did you learn about their general needs from somewhere? Or are they already active clients of yours?

If they’re already in the wings, then I think the next best step is to sync on Monday about how to connect them to us, and to make sure they feel comfortable with that connection. At which point, we can rev up contracting and any related comms directly with the prospective clients.

Let me know! Thanks, and appreciate you amplifying these opportunities.

Hi Matthew,

The current state of communication and engagement with each client is as follows:

## Leadershipwise (Tenia Davis)

Tenia and I have been working together for the past six weeks weeks on the website redesign using Webflow. Tenia is on an active monthly retainer for [web design and development services](https://services.trentbrew.com). The expiration/renewal date for her contract is December 31st which I believe is opportune timing for a seamless transition to Gumbo.

Regarding the work done so far, the current redesign is viewable at (leadershipwise.webflow.io)[https://leadershipwise.webflow.io]. The design is nearly complete, but additional features like the servant leadership assessment, training modules, and mobile version will require additional development, UI/UX, copyediting, and video editing. I'm Happy to provide more details on the current state of the website if needed.

Our communication has been primarily via text and bi-monthly Zoom meetings, occasionally via email.

I agree that it would be best to sync on Monday to discuss the best way to connect her to Gumbo Media. I'm happy to facilitate the introduction however you see fit.

## Hidden Gems Consulting (Gena C. Lovett)

I've worked with Gena in the past on the brand identity and logo for Hidden Gems Consulting. Gena reached out to me this past Monday via text message to inquire about a website for her book, and she detailed her vision for the website in our most recent conversation. I'm happy to provide more details on the project scope and our conversation. The serendipity of Gena's timing presents an opportunity to bring her directly on board with Gumbo, as we haven't formalized any retainer or project scope yet. This could be a seamless start for her engagement with the team. I'm happy to initiate that conversation before our call on Monday but let me know if it would be best to wait until we sync.

Looking forward to our conv
