Hey Trent,

I hope all is well. Thanks again for all the beautiful work on the site.

I wanted to inquire about maintenance in the future. I have a budget meeting Wednesday of this week about a grant I am hoping to apply to. I was wondering if you might be able to share an estimate fee (this can be a really rough estimate) for quarterly updates and maintenance of the site (specifically adding new content and possible continued customized features for the site). If this is something I should do through Gumbo let me know, but I wanted to ask you directly first.

Sincerely,
Ashley

Hi Dr. Ashley,

I wanted to reach out and thank you for the opportunity to work with you on The Rolling Archives. It's so exciting to have officially launched üöÄ I'm really happy with how it turned out and I hope you are too. I'm looking forward to working with you on an ongoing basis to maintain the site, add new content, and make any changes as needed.

I do want to make sure things are clear on all fronts before moving forward so please let me know if it would be best to wait until the offboarding process is complete before we begin working together.

I've attached a high-level statement of work for you to review, and upon approval I will send you a contract to sign. The contract will be for a monthly retainer that includes any services you need for the website including: content updates, UI/UX, technical support, video editing, graphic design, etc. More information on the services included and the retainer structure can be found on slide 7. (please note that you may use the promotional code "BLM" to receive $50 off each monthly payment for the entire duration of the contract)

I'm available to answer any questions you may have, so please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm looking forward to working with you!

Best,
Trent

Hi Trent,

Thank you so much for this, it's really helpful. I will be sharing this information with my business manager this week to see how we can get this set up soon. It may be a process to get you signed up as an official contractor with my institution, but I'll get the ball rolling. Look forward to being in touch soon.

Also, I am not sure if this is something that can be addressed at this point, but I noticed from my mobile device the main collage image on the home page isn't the updated one. I've been trying to learn how to edit the site with the guide but not sure how to do it for the mobile version and didn't want to mess things up. Is this something you could change at this point?

Sincerely,
Ashley

Hi Trent,

I hope you are doing well.

I am in touch with my job and before we move forward, I have to run the contract by our legal department. Would you be able to share a draft of the contract with the start date of January 2024 through July 2024 for the $450/month plan. Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Thank you,
Ashley

Hi Dr. Ashley,

Happy holidays! I hope you're doing well.

I want to sincerely apologize for my delayed response. I'm afraid I've encountered some challenges regarding our arrangement and my working relationship with Gumbo Media. I've been in touch with Matthew and the Ops team through November and am awaiting a response on the best course of action. We are meeting at noon on Monday (12/4) to discuss the situation and I will be sure to follow up with you as soon as possible.

I'm so sorry for the inconvenience, and as always, I'm available to answer any questions you may have, so please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks again for your patience and understanding.

Regards,
Trent
