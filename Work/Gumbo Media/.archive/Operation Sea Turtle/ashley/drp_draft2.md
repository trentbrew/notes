Your Role (Trent's Role) and Initial Project: You work as a web/graphic designer at Gumbo Media. You recently completed a successful project for a client, Dr. Ashley P., with a positive outcome and client satisfaction.

Freelance Arrangement with Dr. Ashley: Post-project, Dr. Ashley approached you about a long-term freelance arrangement for website maintenance and creative support. You agreed to this and communicated independently with Dr. Ashley, setting up a scope of work and a retainer agreement.

Gumbo Media's Involvement: Gumbo Media, your employer, intended to retain Dr. Ashley as a client. After discussions with Matthew and the Ops team, it was decided that it's best for Dr. Ashley's retainer to be routed through Gumbo Media. This decision was made despite your freelance agreement with Dr. Ashley and the fact that your rates were lower than Gumbo's usual charges.

Email Communications:

You've been in email correspondence with Dr. Ashley about the freelance work, including sending her a statement of work and discussing contract details.
Parallel to this, you've had email communications with Sierra and the Ops team at Gumbo Media, discussing your role, the project's completion, and the importance of adhering to Gumbo's processes.
Current Challenge: The main challenge now is to update Dr. Ashley on the new arrangement that involves routing her retainer through Gumbo Media and to align with Matthew on how to communicate this change effectively.

# Email for Dr Ashley from Trent

Hi Dr. Ashley,

I hope this message finds you well.

<!-- Make it clear that this is a proposal, and her input is not only welcome but essential. Highlight that her satisfaction and comfort with the arrangement are your top priorities. -->

I wanted to provide you with an update following my recent discussions with Matthew and our team at Gumbo Media regarding your retainer. I feel it's important to be transparent about the situation and to ensure you're comfortable with the following arrangement moving forward:

The Ops Team and I believe it would be best to route your retainer through Gumbo, as we'd be able to leverage the full breadth of Gumbo's resources and expertise.  I'll be able to continue working with you to provide website maintenenance and creative support.

We have another meeting scheduled next Wednesday to finalize the details of this arrangement. One of the key topics we're exploring is how we can effectively navigate the pricing model. The original $450 per month is not a hard cap, and we're considering structuring your scope of work into separate contracts. This could include distinct aspects like maintenance, website migration, and eCommerce, to ensure each area of need is comprehensively addressed.

Our goal is to create a flexible and tailored plan that aligns with your needs and expectations. I believe this approach will offer the best of both worlds â€“ the personalized service you've come to expect, combined with the enhanced capabilities and support of Gumbo Media.

I'll be in touch immediately after our meeting next Wednesday to share the finalized details and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions, concerns, or specific requirements you'd like us to consider in our planning.

Thank you for your understanding and continued trust in this transition. I'm looking forward to the enhanced possibilities this partnership will bring to The Rolling Archives.

Warm regards,
Trent
