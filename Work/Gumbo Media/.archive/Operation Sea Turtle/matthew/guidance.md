"As you’re heading into the close of this initial contract into the holidays, please communicate with Tenia that you’ve seeded a new working relationship and will be folding (most of) your work moving forward through Gumbo Media, a boutique Black-owned agency. And that the continuation of this work, and any new additions—including the mobile site version and add training modules you noted—will be scoped into a new contract, to commence in early January."
