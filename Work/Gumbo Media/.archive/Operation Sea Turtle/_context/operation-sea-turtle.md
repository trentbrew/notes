Overview of `Operation Sea Turtle`:

You work at Gumbo Media as a web/graphic designer and have recently completed a project for a client, Dr. Ashley P.

Post-project, Dr. Ashley approached you about ongoing website maintenance and creative support on a freelance basis. You agreed and initiated a separate arrangement with her outside of Gumbo Media.

Gumbo Media hoped to retain Dr. Ashley as a client, and there were concerns about how your independent arrangement with her might affect this.
Developments:

You had a meeting with Matthew and the Ops team at Gumbo Media to discuss the situation. It was decided that Dr. Ashley's retainer should be routed through Gumbo Media.

You communicated this change to Dr. Ashley, who responded positively and agreed to the new arrangement.

You also have two other clients, Tenia Davis (Leadershipwise) and Gena Lovett (Hidden Gems Consulting), whom you are considering transitioning to Gumbo Media. Tenia is currently on an active retainer with you, and Gena recently inquired about website development for her book.
Recent Communications:

You received an email from Matthew Manning of Gumbo Media, outlining how to proceed with the transitions of Tenia and Gena to Gumbo Media.

For Tenia, he suggested informing her about folding most of your work with her into Gumbo Media, starting with a new contract in January.

For Gena, similar communication was advised, and once she agrees, you're to connect her with Gumbo Media.

Matthew also asked for any relevant communications you've had with both clients to help with scoping the projects in Gumbo's Sales portal.

Additionally, Matthew mentioned discussing what this means for your contract with Gumbo, ensuring that you are staffed on the projects you bring in.
Current Status:

You are preparing to communicate with Tenia and Gena about the transition to Gumbo Media.
You are also gathering relevant documentation and communications to provide to Gumbo Media for a successful transition.

This situation involves careful navigation of client relationships and internal coordination with Gumbo Media. Your role is pivotal in ensuring a smooth transition for the clients while aligning with Gumbo Media's processes and expectations.
