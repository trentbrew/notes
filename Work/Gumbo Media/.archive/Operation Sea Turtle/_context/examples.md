Thanks, [Name]. I sent you an email connecting you to Rebecca, per her request. She'll likely want to arrange for a sync for a couple of hour to hack at some of the web stuff. If you need access to it all, just ask her and she'll provide.
Please keep me looped in on the thread so I can support as needed, and keep track of your hours for this work, as we have a certain number of hours saved for this technical assistance.
Let me know if you have any questions!

Hi [Name] - Finally following up on the Seed Project/Seed, Root, Tree work you'd sent over. Apologies for the delay. I reviewed with the team and we love the following combo:

- We'd love to see the updated seed base (good call on the G)
- And we'd love to see it paired with the original leaves. There's something about the off-kilter, non-symmetrical approach there that we like a lot, and that makes it feel more timeless. Specifically, we're speaking of these two together:

With that in mind, could you also now finalize "The Seed Project" wordmark to pair with it? We'll use what you've already sent for the Seed, Root, and Tree personas. But we'd love to now see a logo version of this that pairs a wordmark with this icon in some fun, creative, but simple way.You should lean into Gumbo branding for this, so either one of the following fonts would work. Here are the raw files: [Akzidenz, Nickson Six, Manofa, Sanchez]

Thanks so much! And let me know if you have any questions.

Good morning [Name],

I wanted to reach out and thank you for the opportunity to work with you on The Rolling Archives. It's so exciting to have officially launched üöÄ I'm really happy with how it turned out and I hope you are too. I'm looking forward to working with you on an ongoing basis to maintain the site, add new content, and make any changes as needed.

I do want to make sure things are clear on all fronts before moving forward so please let me know if it would be best to wait until the offboarding process is complete before we begin working together.

I've attached a high-level statement of work for you to review, and upon approval I will send you a contract to sign. The contract will be for a monthly retainer that includes any services you need for the website including: content updates, UI/UX, technical support, video editing, graphic design, etc. More information on the services included and the retainer structure can be found on slide 7. (please note that you may use the promotional code "BLM" to receive $50 off each monthly payment for the entire duration of the contract)

I'm available to answer any questions you may have, so please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm looking forward to working with you!

Best,
Trenton Brew

Hello team üëãüèæ

I hope yall had a fantastic weekend and holiday! I really appreciate your in-depth feedback and I have updated the designs for the hands, braid, butterfly, and hairpin which can be found here. I'm more than happy to make any additional adjustments or schedule a call this week to discuss them in more detail.

The first drafts for phase 2 have been uploaded here, and I have also textured and vectorized the final selections from phase 1. You can access the PNG and SVG files for those designs in this folder.

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Best,
Trenton Brew

Hello team üëãüèæ

Thank you for taking the time to connect with me today and learn more about the project.

I wanted to touch on the article you mentioned and express that even after a couple of years I'm still confronted with similar challenges and I feel that it's a big part of what drove me to pursue freelance work, and especially what drove me to pursue Gumbo. I think personal barriers become harder to penetrate once enough time is spent in spaces where you can't fully show up, and I'm still learning to break down those personal & creative barriers so I'm grateful for the opportunity to grow with the brand & work with you both, and potentially serve Gumbo across disciplines in the future.

I feel much more aligned with the project after connecting, and will be getting started on the first few iterations right away.

Thanks again,
Trenton Brew

Good morning team üëãüèæ

Please find the first 20 icon drafts here. Each one has a few rough iterations in PDF format. They are all solid black at the moment but can be textured. I've attached a few texture options to this email for your review.

Feel free to add comments & feedback in the Google Drive folder, as I'm happy to make any adjustments. I'm also available anytime the rest of this week or next to take a deeper look together if necessary.

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Best,
Trenton Brew
