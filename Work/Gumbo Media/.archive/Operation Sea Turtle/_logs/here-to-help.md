Thank you for sharing the directory structure of your projects. It indeed provides a clear picture of your workload and the complexity of the projects you're handling. Here are my thoughts:

Gumbo Media:

You're handling multiple client projects, each with its own set of deliverables and requirements. The projects for Hidden Gems Consulting and Leadershipwise are particularly active and seem to involve a significant amount of work, including branding, document management, and potentially web development.

In addition, you're also working on internal projects like Gumbo Glyphs and The Seed Project. These projects, while not client-facing, still require time and resources.

Turtle Labs:

Your side hustle as a solo entrepreneur/software engineer involves a wide range of projects, from APIs and Apps to Extensions and Websites. Some of these projects are active, and others are ongoing or inactive. The active projects, like Bezi and Maya, seem to be quite complex and would require a significant amount of your time.

Assessment:

Given the number of active projects and the complexity of the tasks involved, it's crucial to ensure that you're not overcommitting yourself. Transitioning your clients to Gumbo Media could provide additional resources and support, but it's important to consider how this will impact your workload and whether you'll be able to effectively manage all these projects.

It might be beneficial to prioritize your projects based on factors like deadlines, client expectations, and the potential impact on your business. This could help you manage your time more effectively and ensure that you're focusing on the most important tasks.
