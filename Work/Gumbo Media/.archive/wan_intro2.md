<!-- This is an email to Matthew, introducing Lawan. I want to let Matthew know that I've been working with Lawan for a few years and we work really well together and he's great at Web and
digital design and he is interested in helping out at gumbo and I think it could be a great opportunity to delegate more of the box-build, marketing, and branding stuff to lawan. I
would like to spend more time with product development and internal stuff. I already discussed this with Matthew in our last sync and Matthew is interested in onboarding Lawan for some upcoming contract work. This message is a warm introduction between Matthew and Lawan facilitated by Trent (me). -->
<!-- allow for wan and matthew to chat on their own terms about setting up a call to discuss how Lawan could best contribute to Gumbo's projects moving forward -->
<!-- artistic cooridor in oak park to honor a black scientist who created patents in that area. street scaping design – we'd be creating the brand identity, packaging, working with an architectural firm. his role in the alter stages would be renderings. -->

Hey Matthew,

I am connecting you with Lawan Alade-Fa, a talented web & digital designer I've had the pleasure of working with over the past few years. Lawan has expressed a keen interest in contributing to client work at Gumbo, particularly in areas of graphic design, 3D design, marketing, branding, and creative strategy.

Given our recent discussions about delegating more responsibilities to focus on internal initiatives, and the alignment of Lawan's skillset with our current needs, I believe Lawan could be a valuable addition to our team.

In addition to the work I've shared previously, Lawan has put together some additional examples of his graphic design work which can be found [HERE](https://www.studiolafa.design/niche/a-few-more-examples).

Lawan is CC'd here for you to chat with him directly. Let me know if there's anything I can do to further support!

Best,
Trent

I think Bronzeville is the only client site under the Gumbo account (at least that I have access to). Since the Gumbo site will be in Framer I think it will be fine to delete it, but I'd be open to discuss further during our next sync to make sure we're covering all bases.
