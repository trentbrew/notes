Hi Matthew,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude for the meeting we had on Monday with the Ops team. It was a valuable learning experience for me, and I greatly appreciate the time and effort you put into creating a space for open dialogue and alignment. The insights shared have not only been instrumental in shaping my understanding of our processes and client relations, but also my perspective on the impact that my actions have on the team and the company as a whole. I'm committed to ensuring that im

The following is a brief overview of the situation as I understand it

1. Successful project completion with Dr. Ashley, leading to her interest in ongoing website maintenance and creative support.
2. Initial freelance arrangement with Dr. Ashley, independent of Gumbo.
3. Reflection on the importance of adhering to Gumbo's processes and protocols.
4. Proposal to expand Gumbo's services to better accommodate clients like Dr. Ashley.
5. Recent decision to route Dr. Ashley's retainer through Gumbo, affecting the initial freelance pricing structure.

I've attached an email draft to Dr. Ashley, communicating these changes and would really value your feedback on it (drp_draft.md). Her latest communication was a request for a contract with a start date of January 2024 through July 2024 for the $450/month plan. I understand that the retainer structure would be different than the original freelance arrangement, and I'm happy to discuss the details of that with you, as well as any systems or processes that would need to be put in place to support a full-stack project like this.

Additional attachments:

- Scope of Work (drp_scope.md): I've attached the original SOW slide deck for reference.
- Email Thread (drp_thread): For full transparency, I've attached the email thread between Dr. Ashley and I which contains the entirity of our communication outside of Gumbo.

I'll also be in touch with the sales team this week regarding the two leads I mentioned on Monday: Tenia Davis (Leadershipswise), Gena Lovett (Hidden Gems Consulting).

Happy to discuss any of this over a call if that would be helpful.
Looking forward to your thoughts.

Summarizing Elaine’s thoughts above, I think we should…

Lean into the combination of leaves, arching flowers, stem as arch, and singular flower breaking the plain combination
Sketch up a new version combining these elements using Elaine’s quick mockup as reference.
Use the shape of the flowers from the first, but scale them up slightly to align with the size in the second mockup.
Make the necessary adjustments based on our own instincts once all elements have come together.
For example, I believe the leaves on the bottom need to be lower on the side of the lower-most Lily from the top. Right now, they’re touching, and I believe some asymmetry there could provide balance and leave more space between the lowest Lily and the leaf below it.
Generally, make it sharper, more symmetrical (not as a total composition, but respective to each Lily, less rustic, etc.
Generate final 1-3 illustrations, and pair with different type treatments and color palettes for a full range of options based on the same logo.
