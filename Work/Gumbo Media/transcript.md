This is a transcript of an interview with the founder at Gumbo (Matthew Manning). I just listened to the whole thing, and I'm wondering if you can cherry pick any quotes from this interview that might work for this section of the website at the end of the about page. It should encapsulate the ethos of Gumbo in just one or two sentences.

# Here is the transcript:

00:00:01	back with another episode I have a man here uh Matthew Manning he was so gracious to bless me with his time his energy and his Insight I'm sure that you guys are are watching on YouTube you are listening on Spotify Apple uh you know put on your seat belts um because this is going to be a pack show I definitely want to give him a shout out for all of the work that he's doing with gumbo media uh his motivation uh careers motivational speaking career has been uh great uh so I would like to welcome to

00:00:34	the show co-founder creative director of Gumbo Matthew Manning welcome to the show thank you man appreciate it happy to be here oh absolutely uh so let's dive right into it how was early childhood for you yeah I mean it's a complex question for me because I'm an immigrant to this country so early childhood was kind of split between a European reality and an American reality um I was born in Stockholm in Sweden um my mom was uh actually of Swedish and biracial um so she's of Swedish ancestry and she was

00:01:13	really connected with her grandfather growing up who was a Swedish immigrant uh or great-grandfather was sweet summer Grand but her grandfather spoke mostly only Swedish and um my father was a singer uh born in Virginia so both american-born parents but found his way to Europe as a singer and was touring as an artist and so they met there while my mom was sitting abroad and what my father was performing and um ended up having three kids I was the first and so I grew up there they stayed there for 20 years and my Swedish

00:01:41	childhood was beautiful you know I had a very diverse uh kind of group friends we were from all over the place all over the world really mostly first generation swedes and so that was really interesting and then when I moved to the United States which was in Minneapolis um it was a beautiful place um and I had a really good good group of friends there as well the American reality was a little bit more harsh and so there were a lot of things that you know I dealt with as a kid both in my family and just in kind of society that

00:02:10	uh I reflect on now I think at the time I was probably a little bit woe is me about uh but now you know those are things that I think have sharpened my my toolkit as just somebody who works really hard um and understands what it takes to you know to get things done and is always willing to learn uh and to figure out the solutions and so I think that's that's where a lot of entrepreneurial Spirit came from so all in all it was a very joyful playful happy childhood uh there were you know plenty of challenges

00:02:38	a few traumas you know like like for us all but um but those things have all helped me become the person I am today so that's awesome man I love to hear I want to like pause here for a second uh to hear about your your Early Childhood did your parents Foster Arts you said your dad was a jazz singer so how was Mom uh being supportive as well yeah they they definitely I think cultivated a home where Arts were deeply appreciated um yeah my father was a jazz Blue Soul gospel funk singer any any kind of music

00:03:12	that in the spirit of of black music Traditions which really is all music uh he did um and so I grew up you know singing and wanting to play instruments and just immersed in music I mean my parents tell me stories about how you know I was I was a pretty quiet kid apparently but you know the few times I would cry they would put on like the Winans or you know some old like gospel group and I would just you know I would just go quiet and I would enjoy it and so like music even at like age one was my way of you know

00:03:42	it was a way of kind of contenting my spirit which is great um and then my mom was was always you know mad supportive I've always been a narcissistic kid when I grew up I mean I started drawing I started playing with Legos when I was like super young and I would build at eight years old I would build like entire airplanes just from memory right like houses and entire Villages I wasn't you know building sets so much I was buying sets to get interesting pieces and would assemble my own things and so I wanted to be an

00:04:09	architect from a really young age um and because of that I really fell in love with art um visual art and so I was a visual artist growing up I was always excelling in my art classes um you know I was I was always kind of one of the best at drawing and things like that and so I was just a really really right-brained thinker and it took a long time for me to later develop my kind of my left brain business thinking and I'm still working on it um but I always approached the world from kind of a visual language and I

00:04:38	think what I appreciate the most about my parents was one my father he had that same skill set he wasn't very book smart but he was really street smart he was really creatively smart if not a creative genius and and my mother was just always really nurturing and supportive of that and she had similar passions Growing Up music art things of that nature so she she encouraged me to lean into it you know she would do she does things like even a couple of years ago buying me a paint set even though I

00:05:03	haven't painted all the you know 20 years she's still cultivating and nurturing kind of that side of me and I think it it gave me permission to explore freely who I am as an artist which I think is what makes me different as an entrepreneur today right um is the fact that I think from a different perspective and I'm not afraid of approaching life and business from those perspectives shout out to your pops for the Winans I grew up on a wine as you came from the same type of background my dad loves

00:05:33	Jazz he put me on to Jazz I listened to Jazz on a regular basis we go to concerts things of that nature so uh shout out to your parents man they did a great job um so so then we're gonna let's get forward to um your your college education right like but no let's go back to high school how was your art experience uh in high school thank you it was good I was at um a school called Southwest in Minneapolis which is a public school it's always kind of charting in the top 50 100 public schools in the country so it's like a

00:06:05	very good public school to the point where it's almost bordering like a private school education um part of that I think is um is funding a lot of it is privilege right um it's a very very white school um and I was kind of a token right like I was one of the few black kids I remember having this very clear moment which I'm writing about actively in some of my work but in I think third grade I which was the first full year of school in the United States it was a very diverse School the school I went to

00:06:37	um obviously Elementary School was called Fulton Academy and they changed the busing districts over the summer I had no idea what that meant you know I was I was a new American I didn't really even understand the concept of race yet um because it's not to say that there isn't racism or race in uh Sweden of course there is but it's a different type of Dynamics a different type of discourse especially that early on um and fourth grade I realized with attention the busing districts meant because I met all of the black and brown

00:07:06	people were suddenly gone and so I remember walking in feeling like oh I was part of this very diverse cluster of people that I loved and now I'm walking in and I'm the only person or one of two people that looked like me in the entire hallway and the entire floor right and so just feeling that shift in my reality I carried that all the way through high school um and so I think there was a lot of kind of cognitive dissonance I was um tried to kind of um I think I was trying to figure out who I was but also kind of uh ignoring

00:07:37	who I was in some capacities because it meant dealing with a lot of you know kind of bitter realities about race and privilege and things of that nature um but I think you know artistically I felt that in a similar way in the sense that high school it was an IB Program International Baccalaureate it was a lot of uh AP studies um advanced placement I think it is I don't remember but so it was a lot of like really high level education which was great for me um in terms of preparing me for college

00:08:07	and stuff but it was very technical in many cases uh in at times it was a bit critical you know um critical thinking and things of that nature but a lot of it was very technical so it's very left-brained and so there were times where I really struggled right I mean as an immigrant I didn't speak English fluently until fourth grade so things like standardized testing because of my right brain thinking because I you know process language differently than a lot of other people um like noun and verb placement are

00:08:35	opposite in Swedish and so the way that I naturally think about a phrase in the sentence might be different than a lot of my friends those things made things like standardized testing for me difficult to the point where you know I kind of thought it was dumb for a lot of school um you know because I just I couldn't despite my best efforts I couldn't do things as well I hit a wall in English I hit a wall in math I hit a wall and all these things that I just I couldn't get past I think some of that was dealing

00:09:02	with the trials of home but the moment that really did it for me and I think changed my entire trajectory as a career especially with my passion for architecture was I remember I was in a history class I think it was ibap HL so higher level two uh history so it's like the highest level I could be in in history and we were learning history and it was great you know it was fine I love my professors as a duel or teacher this was a dual teacher class um and then one day they brought in a uh a art history Professor or art history

00:09:39	teacher and he was actually one of my art teachers from earlier on in my high school path and he came in and he did the entire curriculum that we had done the last I don't know four or five weeks in one seminar and did it through an art historical lens and I remember suddenly all of these things that I've been learning for four or five weeks just started clicking and I just understood it in a different way and it was one of those moments where I was like oh you can blend these things you can blend the

00:10:05	rest the left brain and the right brain I can take a historical or an artistic approach to history or to math or to English or to whatever these studies might be and so I think that was one of the defining moments for me so much uh so much to the point where I ended up being an art history major in college just a few months later at the Paul University in Chicago and so um that had a big impact on me and I think I did do his you know art classes and stuff like that and school as well but a lot of that was earlier on and so

00:10:36	I do think that part of me was stifled a bit until that kind of moment of Clarity click to let you know in my last few months at school so I was grateful for that for sure let's talk about the Paul like what was your experience like at DePaul like you know and the second question would be like did you um get a mentor or mentors while you were there and do you still have them to this day yeah it's a great question um DePaul was great I love DePaul I think DePaul was really where I found my stride as a critical thinker as a leader

00:11:16	as a servant leader as a designer frankly as an artist but also on my community specifically in black community um it was something that I had to choose it was something that I had to explore for myself because I've been limited from that I mean I have obviously a black father I have black siblings I you know had plenty of um black friends growing up and all of that but I think learning to kind of find my tribe and find my community was something that I had to decide for myself and something that to me just

00:11:51	resonated at on a whole different level and allowed me to unlock a part of myself that I felt had been kind of stifled because I had been a token almost my entire life and so um that was I think the most beautiful part of that experience um and I'm forgetting the first the the second part of that question I was not asking about your mentors uh along that oh yeah yeah yeah and so part of that Journey was being a mentor in a program called men of color and so there was a guy named Frankie Valencia

00:12:24	on DePaul University campus he was I think a junior maybe a senior I was a a freshman and I would see him in the hallways you know we you know we were kind of Buddy Buddy he would you know we'd always say what's up always tap each other up um and he kept telling me you should come out to this program it's called men of color initiative I think you'd really like it um and I wasn't so sure I mean I think you know the Young The Young arrogance and pride in me was like refusing the the thought that I could use

00:12:55	mentorship or that would benefit from guidance and mentorship you know I saw probably I probably saw myself as a young leader as the mentor more than I did the mentee um even though it wasn't about that um and even though I could have used it and um I finally saw him one day uh in the office that I went to is I think the diversity office or whatever it was and that's the program that's where the program was held from and he walked in and he was like no I'm serious I want you to come out uh and I want you to to show up uh

00:13:25	and I said okay I got you um and a couple of weeks later on Halloween he actually was shot and killed um in Chicago um and I didn't know him well but I knew him enough and he had had a big enough impression on me and I kind of made this promise in that I would go and so I decided to to show up and to go and so a couple of weeks later I did go uh and I met somebody who I believe was kind of a mentor for me through those years and and some of the years shortly after college his name was Eric Mata he

00:13:55	ran the program and I met other people like Andre Bob and Andrew and a few other folks who were super dope to me and kind of mentors and guidances for me throughout and just to have that safe space for black and brown people um were just chopping it up and having conversations and discourse about what it means to be a man of color about um the things that we were feeling and to have a vulnerable space but also um you know a strong space in an accountable space of people that cared for you nurtured you held you

00:14:24	accountable to the things you wanted to do how'd you accountable to the things you were doing wrong I think was really powerful and instrumental for me and so I was a mentee in that program for um I think a year maybe two and then I became a mentor for the rest of the the time that I was in that program and so as a mentor as a peer mentor I would have a couple of mentees uh I think we each had less of about eight to ten and we would set up meetings and just be around campus and meet up for a second

00:14:51	you know over you know quesadillas over lunch or whatever it was and and just chop it up and uh and be there for them and help can make you know connect the dots and so to feel that happen for me and then to be able to do that for others I think was really instrumental and Eric Mata was um I think probably my biggest Mentor during that time there were a few others I was in you know Gospel Choir I was in a cappella group I was in a lot of leadership circles and you know leaders yeah so I'm getting a little bit from my

00:15:22	dad I haven't sung in a while but um but so because of that I you know I had other mentors kind of in a more pure capacity in other places but Eric definitely had a foundational impression on me and I remember one moment specifically that I still think about he really changed the way I thought about masculinity um and the impact masculinity has on the world and so one of the things that he talked about was you know we this was when we started noticing you know the the killings and kind of these slangs of black and brown bodies

00:15:54	increasing um or at least the visibility of them increasing because of Technology um where we noticed uh conversations on um you know accessibility rights and uh and other forms of Human Rights increasing um and all sorts of other things uh political conversations and discourse were increasing I mean again this is the rise of like Twitter and Facebook and all these things so everything was just feeling more in your face every day and uh school students was another one and I remember Eric saying one thing

00:16:26	that we never talk about and at the time it was true is that all of the people who are perpetrating these violent acts are men we always talk about race we always talk about mental health we always talk about all these different things we never talk about the fact that it's not women going out here and doing these things at least the vast majority of the time right 99 of the time and what does that say about the conversation Gap around masculinity uh around the conversation Gap around mentorship and guidance and all of these

00:16:57	things that we could really provide for each other um to have safer spaces what does that say about the lack of opportunity we feel uh we feel we have to talk about the things that are you know ailing us um and and that we result in other things and that's not to say that you know a lack of space provided by others is the culprit for you know it's not to put any kind of outer excuse for uh accountability accountability needs to happen regardless but it made me think about and Elevate masculinity as

00:17:27	one of the first conversations that we needed to have in every conversation in every discourse I was engaged with you know and at the time I was writing a lot about race I was writing a lot about um religion I grew up in a religious household um and uh I'm not as religious uh these days I'm much more just kind of a spiritual uh an energy driven person but um but these became intersections for me right and they dovetailed with conversations on masculinity and so that was that was a key Mentor for me who really shaped

00:17:58	the way I see the world even today and it's so impactful man and uh you know those are one in a lifetime type of uh you know situations with mentors right I have mentored myself that I still from high school that I share that same sentiment um so you do a lot of great work I see the the worldwide orphanage uh relief correlation you did I speak in Chicago or I speak Chicago can we briefly talk about those things yeah so as a freshman in college I think it was like October 14th something like that

00:18:37	um I I dealt with trying to find the the easiest way to talk about this um I dealt with a lot of mental health issues growing up because of some of the things that I was enduring in Minneapolis and uh because of that by the time I got to college I'd already been depressed for you know seven eight years like a big chunk of my childhood um my father was was a bit more absent than I would have liked for him to have been earlier on um you know just be rebuilding that friendship over the last few years

00:19:08	frankly um there were a lot of things at home I was working full-time as a student which is you know basically illegal but but I had to in order to help cover the bills and help support my mom I was helping to raise my sisters and so all of these were wakes that I was feeling and I was suppressing what I was feeling until I got into college really and the one thing that made me feel good was service was giving back to others and so by the time I got to college and I was on my own and I didn't have as

00:19:36	many of the familial pressures as many and still had them in some capacities I got involved in all the student organizations too many frankly to the point where I got too busy and I was now you know just like burying myself and hiding from you know truths by burying myself in service but it was the one thing that like eased I got these physical like pains and contractions in my stomach which was physical pain from mental and emotional strain and um and the only time that they subsided was when I was like

00:20:06	smiling and laughing with other people in some kind of a service capacity and um I took a trip that I I raised uh raised up for for a couple of years by doing um doing events and uh fundraisers and stuff at our school I asked to rent the school space well we have given the school space for free in the auditorium and I would have people come out and do a talent show and people would pay tickets and I did that for a couple of years to raise enough money to then go to Ghana and I got some additional support right

00:20:35	after three days after my graduation and this is right when I'm kind of Reckoning with my um with my depression and so I go to Ghana I um have an amazing experience that I work in an orphanage in a kind of a Northeastern remote part of Ghana called in quanta uh which is the lake Volta region and um I worked there for six six or seven weeks I mean I'm there for the entire summer before College to the point where my roommate for college is like where is this guy and does he not like me like why haven't I heard from him

00:21:07	um I just completely forgot about all things America but it was it was the freest I'd ever felt um it was the the happiest I felt frankly in like a decade um and so I thought about what like what is it about this that you know that is important to me but also um these kids who comparatively you know here I am kind of woe is me and these kids comparatively and it's not a comparison but you know just to lean into that for a second they have nothing compared to me right and yet they are as happy as can be

00:21:39	um and they couldn't be any more kind of um well they they are they're knowingly um choosing to choose happiness despite you know what they're what they see around them and in some cases I don't think they know what they don't have right right um and so for me that was a difficult thing to kind of grapple with because it doesn't necessarily get easier when you get home you still have to reckon with the lack of uh the lack of happiness you have but now you also are aware of the fact that you should have more happiness because these

00:22:09	kids that have around the world have it and you don't and you have everything that they wish they had right and so I'm kind of racking my mind around that and so when I get to college I lean into service organizations and all of that I end up starting a non-profit organization completely naively I did it as a freshman um you know I filled out an application online I was doing that on a Wednesday night instead of doing my homework I remember being up to like two or three in the morning a few late days later in

00:22:34	the mail I get this you know this kind of notice the Articles from corporation that say Hey you know here's here's your organization and I start leading that for a few years initially it's kind of volunteer based which I eventually canceled because it ended up feeling too much for a lot of folks like it was kind of voluntourism you know it's another resume check mark and like for me that was never a consideration I just want to go and be present and serve um but it's a very Americanized way of thinking about it it's a very

00:23:02	westernized way of thinking about it you know it makes us feel good to go and serve other people who don't have as much it's not actually benefiting them in any real way because it's only done through a charitable lens and so I started thinking more about sustainability lens and that's when over over about course of you know five six years the organization evolved and it eventually started doing some really good work in Uganda Rwanda um and uh Sierra Leone and in some cases Ghana and what we did was a sustainable Small

00:23:32	Business Development so we would invest in a lot of the small business practices that we saw and we would use our connections to the global economy to basically help increase their yields and help increase the productivity so that they could have more money to make for themselves but it was them investing in their own businesses as opposed to us just coming here to serve right and so that's kind of what it became beekeeping practices tree nurseries Piggery stuff like that uh we would basically say hey

00:23:58	what do you need okay let us go back fetch a lot of these resources and come back give you these things and now they could increase their yields or times you know what they what they were stuff like that so that's kind of what where that became and then I speak was um was kind of a Coalition in Chicago of folks coming together to change news Cycles this is again the height of kind of 24-hour news cycles and Twitter and stuff like that and Chicago was and continues to be picked on all the time unnecessarily and unfairly so on

00:24:29	inaccurately so for it's violence right and so um it I speak was our attempt to bring people together to kind of shift and provide another way of sharing news and sharing um you know messaging around Chicago that was positive and that was highlighting kind of the art scene and the positivity scenes and things like that that were happening in the city I will say though both of those were very kind of naive and were us as a lot of privileged individuals stepping in into situations that were far more complex

00:25:00	than we understood and into situations that we didn't have proper context for and so evolved my way out of both of them but I'm very and eternally grateful for um the experience that I got in both because it made me I think part of the leader that I am today and informed leadership from kind of an international relief Aid perspective from a local you know news perspective in a local um kind of context in terms of what we know what we don't know the Privileges we hold things of that nature and there's lots more

00:25:30	stories there but for sake of time I'll defer those to a different day wow amazing um so I definitely want to and that it seems like it's a it's a story right it's a story that you're taking me on the story and that makes sense and we're gonna we're getting to gumbo media right like I've done a little research the website looks amazing you guys have so many things I just want to start with the gumbo media part like what is the primary function and how do you go about recruiting your team members um they

00:26:03	seem like they have a lot of experience yeah so gumbo media kind of emerged from what we call a deficit or Gap it was 2016. this is kind of a 48-hour span where Alton Sterling and philando Castile were both uh killed um I'm from Minneapolis and philando was just you know miles away from kind of where I grew up um and so just feeling those two very heavily obviously also on the heels of Taiwan Martin and and um you know the the many many others and and I just felt my my perspective and my lens shifting I

00:26:41	think we were um I was doing a lot of Consulting brand Consulting so you think about my kind of architecture experience growing up you think about my graphic design you think about my copywriting and my writing that I was starting to do all of those things kind of culminated into Consulting right I could help others better polish and tell their stories because I have the skill set visually and narratively to help them make those things shine but also strategically because of my non-profit experience as kind of a young

00:27:08	naive entrepreneur and so that's where it kind of Blended itself to but I found myself committing a lot of time to institutions that didn't seem to care about diversity and Equity uh both in terms of the teams that I was a part of as well as in terms of the the clients that we served the teams that I was part of a lot of them claimed they did but it didn't feel like they ever worked hard enough to actually make it a reality right you can talk the talk but how do you actually walk the walk um and so when those uh when that

00:27:39	happened in July of 2016 I think I was at a place where I was like my tithes are shifting I'm sick of putting all of my energy and time into all of these different places and all of us doing that at the same time like what happens if we all come together and mobilize those efforts and um my partner and I she's my business partner and also my life partner um we went to a uh wedding and it was kind of a brief moment of levity in the midst of all that grief right and we were talking about a magazine that we've

00:28:11	been wanting to start um because we loved magazines we love coffee table books stuff like that and we kind of posed the idea and we decided we were thinking about it as like a five-year plan and we decided why not you know I think it was her her name is Courtney she said why not do it now so we're like okay yeah let's do it now and as we started thinking about it and talking about it we realized that what we needed and wanted to do was actually to build kind of a media media ecosystem so it wasn't just about a publication it was

00:28:37	about meeting people where they're at not everybody reads a magazine not everybody listens to a podcast not everybody's on social but everybody engages in some way with storytelling right how can we build an ecosystem that allows us to meet people where they're at and use that ecosystem not to amplify celebrity stories because those are the same 3 400 stories we hear in the cycle over and over and over again and not to perpetuate you know stereotypes about our communities that are like the Fox News cycle right because that's that's

00:29:04	what I speak in a lot of those initiatives are for but how do we go into the middle those 46 million it might probably more now you know black Americans that live in this country that are everyday people and deserve to see themselves as an everyday person reflected with more complexity and more nuance and so we built um we built an organization around that or a company around that and around that effort it started around Community um and so a lot of events and programs stuff like that panel discussions you

00:29:34	know uh Kickbacks you know happy hours whatever just come together Vibe chill learn about each other build um we did a lot of content so we had original storytelling series we were doing digital video production stuff like that um and then we had Services which I was just doing as the brand consultant in me I've been doing this stuff so this is a way that we can pay the bills uh for the business you know Nimble lean operation and then when covet happened we couldn't do the community stuff as much anymore

00:30:05	and the content stuff didn't make as much sense because it's high cost and it's kind of low yield until you can build up enough eyeballs and Impressions that you can then start making money off ad dollars and stuff like that but we also you know don't want to just have kind of traditional capitalist ways of just pulling in ads that don't mean anything to our community we want to we want to make sure that that has a purpose too right like black owned Brands and stuff that people should know about

00:30:28	um and so we really leaned into the services and that was in 2020 and we fell into a niche which is again we're seeing kind of this racial Reckoning happening with Brianna Taylor and uh Ahmad harbury and George Floyd people want to work with black Brands um and they realize their shortcomings in terms of black storytelling and at least inclusive storytelling and so uh at the same time it's coven people are stuck at home they're starting to build up their own ideas they're starting to build up their own businesses so at the

00:30:59	same time people are looking for a diverse group of you know brand consultants and brain concerns that can bring their ideas to life and we just happen to already be existing and be in that Niche and so kind of unintentionally we fit a market need and we just grew and scaled about two thousand percent over a couple of years and we went from about 19k in Revenue because we had no reason to make more than that that was just what we that wasn't ever our focus in 2019 to about 600 000 or 200 000 in 2019 and about six

00:31:30	hundred thousand um the year after in 2020 and that was very rapid growth and so that was really exciting for us and so we just kind of leaned into that and along the way I you know I just I've been building this large network of creatives just because that was my own world and so I just would pull friends in and say Hey I want to work with you would you want to be a part of this like let's let's pull more energy away from those white institutions and start building up for our own people and for our own

00:31:57	communities and others can be a part of this other identities can be a part of this but they need to honor the fact that this is a black space first right um and that's kind of what we've built and I think over time people have stayed we get questions about retention a lot activation for us has been easy um but retention has also been somewhat easy for us and I think part of it is because it's us it's us chopping it up we're talking about our hair Journeys 15 minutes before we start the the strategy right we're actually checking

00:32:28	in on each other and how we're feeling we're putting in Community Care Clauses that allow us to honor what it feels like to be a black person trying to work amidst International or you know National trauma in the news cycle right all of those things are part of our infrastructure so it just it's a space that feels more Community it feels more uh you know kind of familial and I think that's really how this the team has built it's been kind of organic and right now we have about 40 to 45 contractors

00:32:55	it's a very contract-based team we're just now taking the turn into kind of W-2 employees for operations and you know larger kind of strategy type roles and then the contract team will be the contract team and they they're the ones who execute a lot of the services for clients so and now we're coming full circle and bringing back the the rest of the stuff as well that's amazing so are you still hands on with a lot of projects or are you kind of like removed and like more guiding the the project

00:33:22	yeah I'm uh I'm Hands-On and select projects more so as a strategist these days I'm not doing really any design anymore every once in a while you know people's time lapses or you know things just dovetail in a way where it's like okay somebody needs to fill this this Gap that is emerging can somebody offer a few extra design hours things like that happen um so every once in a while I'll dive in but for the most part I don't really do any design anymore I don't really do any copywriting anymore um outside of my own personal you know

00:33:53	writer's Journey um but in gumbo I'm more of building up the operations team Small Business Development so I'm building up about six new business ventures within gumbo the broader umbrella of Gumbo this year so that we can start removing ourselves from kind of all eggs in one basket type of model that we have right now and services building up teams culture stuff like that um and then on projects I work maybe on one or two projects as opposed to you know 11 to 12 in the past and that's mostly in a strategic capacity

00:34:25	it's like obviously tell that you're passionate about it um yeah it seems like did you play sports in high school right were you active or because I see that the government yeah yeah no I was definitely active I did um I did basketball um I wasn't in high school basketball or anything it was all like church league stuff I was kept it more recreational more fun especially because our high school was was pretty trash anyway um so I don't think it was a lot of fun it was a lot of work with not a lot of rewards

00:34:53	so um I did uh yeah I did a lot of college ball did a lot of intramurals through college I mean I'm sorry a high school ball a lot of intramurals through college stuff like that so I've always stayed active and then I did my first marathon in 2014. um year after graduating and I think I was just had a period when I was just like I just needed to prove to myself that I could do it and I didn't train properly I didn't really have a community to do that um but I did it and um struggled through it and then years

00:35:22	later but through that I found running right running became not like a big passion of mine but something that I could depend on to get exercise and uh it was healing in some ways too and uh my partners actually became kind of an avid Runner um while I was away doing some work she did like a 30-day running Challenge and she just she stuck with it she's still with it she's at she's at a workout right now um and um Nike approached her uh we had already started gumbo uh for and been doing it for a couple years and Nike approached

00:35:53	her they were finding leaders in the community and she kind of naturally risen as a leader um and they decided to kind of invest in her in a way um they didn't like pay her anything but what they wanted to do was help provide some of the capital and more so more of the in-kind support to be able to start kind of a running initiative on the south side of Chicago which is where we lived and it was really a stop Gap in the folks that were able in in communities like that on the south side of Chicago at the time now there's not

00:36:19	now there's a lot on the South and West sides and I think gumbo fit helped kind of bridge that change so we built an extension of Gumbo media which is gumbo fit and wellness had always been kind of a key element of this and this is more the fitness element of Wellness right so we built that out um you know we're told it's going to be tough to start you just got to be consistent as long as you're always showing up people will show up and we did we showed up every Saturday morning for you know runs even when it was

00:36:45	really cold outside even it was just me and Courtney ended up taking a run by ourselves nobody else showed up right but eventually people started to come out um we got a couple features in Nike which helped a lot and really propelled the community and um and now it's it's a big initiative powered by Nike running and we're working on some really amazing ideas and anybody wants to check out gumbo fade is in Chicago once the running Community check that out even if you're not in Chicago you just want an

00:37:10	inspiration check that out it's just combo fit and gumbo media respectively on on IG um but it's it's really become its own thing like it's just it's a massive massive community of Runners and fitness enthusiasts who are just coming together to run together uh very based in black and brown running and fitness communities but there's a broad broad swath of people coming out just to support because they like the Vibes right holding each other accountable um just having fun with each other and enjoying this this as a way to to

00:37:41	release thank healthy now will you have a gumbo fit LA or uh is that in the cards yeah we're figuring that out um I think Courtney's when covet happened we really have to like burrow deep to like make sure that we can sustain these communities and so I really became the leader of Gumbo media and she really became the leader of Gumbo fit even though we co-founded both of those together um so she's she's kind of leading that charge there are some models I won't share them yet because they're so very

00:38:09	much in the ideation phase and don't want to over commit over promise anything but we're working on some really cool ideas for how we're going to help sustain both of those communities regardless of where you're at and so there are ways that we're hoping to bring more of a presence to Los Angeles and really all other places um I don't know how much of that presence will be a physical presence and I think part of that is also not wanting to assume here comes the gun on trying to understand what the needs are in La you

00:38:37	know like we lived in Chicago for a long time we saw what the Gap was and we filled it um we don't want to assume that those gaps are here in La you know we want to be able to live here for long enough to be able to understand what the gaps are and then figure out if we're the right people to fill those gaps and in what way uh as opposed to just jumping in and building a new presence because there are a lot of other running groups out here so to be determined we'll see okay I'll definitely keep my eyes open and the

00:39:05	last thing I want to do as we land This Plane is talk about uh black words how did that come about yeah so blackboards.co was started we're actually it's funny you mentioned that because I have a call I think today or maybe tomorrow morning um we're going to be redeveloping that um and building it out as a custom site um but we started this part of I think the role that we feel like we serve at gumbo is thinking through again what are the gaps that exist and how can we help fill them and one of the gaps

00:39:40	that I realize with my skill set in writing and my experience in writing and obviously my everybody has to write in college um but also my intersection in thinking about race and all these different things masculinity Etc um I was doing a lot of searches like you know quotes by black authors you know quotes by black athletes or leaders or whatever I mean even just managing a social media page you're going to find yourself doing a lot of that if those are the intersections that you're kind of engaged in and I was like there

00:40:16	really doesn't feel like there's one a One-Stop shop to get this content um and that to me began to feel like a gap but also began to feel like an amazing business opportunity for us to to build around and so we basically went through a process of aggregating um you know as many quotes as we can we only got through you know I think like the bees um there's so many more to do um and then covet hit and focus has kind of shifted because this is kind of all a free you know uh thing that we were committing to it was kind of a volunteer

00:40:46	effort now we have more of an infrastructure to reinvest in it so the goal is to kind of let the platform it's just blackwords.co um but it's a great source for quotes we do see the faction and people are actually using it still people have found it I think just from you know some of the uh from either being connected to our uh uh platforms or maybe hopefully SEO and just searching online keyword searches stuff like that so our goal is to make it like the biggest repository for black quotes in the world

00:41:15	um and to kind of have that up there so it's really easy for folks to find quotes from Black authors thought leaders Community Builders um you know revolutionaries whatever it might be really accessibly and so we're working on you'll see it you'll see a facelift for that by probably October of this year which is a exciting so yeah that's where that can't wait I'll definitely uh tap in uh and is there any last words of any um upcoming creative or somebody's in the creative space and they want to make a pivot in a different

00:41:47	you know uh space within the creative uh ecosystem what words of a device would you give them yeah I think I would um I mean one I would encourage people to keep going I think it's very easy we don't prioritize creativity enough especially in kind of business spaces I think even in academic spaces you know the Arts programs and budgets always the first to be cut um and I think because of that it's really easy to feel like there's not enough support there are not enough people that care um and it's really easy to give up but I

00:42:27	think if you're interested in a kind of a creative Pursuit um and hoping to sustain yourself around it one be keyed in and tap into what that passion is because the passion is really what's going to get you through those those dark days and months where um you're second guessing whether or not you should just go back to whatever you were doing before or you know you should find a job that holds you over and all those things and I think all of those things are realistic things that you should also be considering and be fair

00:42:56	and true truthful to yourself about but the key I think for me is not to give up I think the only reason I've been able to sustain myself now for several years around creative Pursuits is because I didn't give up um that's really the only thing that Separates Me from anybody who um hasn't been able to sustain that um I'm not any more talented you know I just I I kept going um and I sacrificed a lot of my 20s to do that but now I'm in my early 30s and I feel like I'm exactly where I'm supposed to

00:43:28	be and I get to enjoy this for the rest of my life and that's really exciting um keep building and growing in that so that's part of it the other thing I would say is just be creative and be unique like lean into that creativity in terms of how you pursue that field as well I think we think very linearly at times and literally at times and I think that's a lot because of how we're educated which is a very left brain kind of linear way of thinking as opposed to you know um thinking kind of constructively and

00:43:56	creatively in broader terms and what I mean by that is like I was an art history student and everybody said everybody joked all the time or how are you going to use that you know all you can do is be an Artistry professor and I'm like where because I can look at any building and break down all of the influences from all over the world like to me this is a cultural snapshot of how the world Works how is that not valuable in any field I could possibly choose right how does that how does that not make me distinct and unique in terms of

00:44:22	how I process the world around me and the businesses around me and my approach to them and I had my entrepreneurial skill set so I was comfortable in any room I wasn't intimidated by XYZ person I didn't care what your resume was like I know I have something to offer this space as well right those things allowed me to kind of feel comfortable in the different rooms that I was entering to pursue things in different ways to think critically about how I can exist you know so instead of if you're loving music

00:44:51	maybe it's not just the music path maybe it's not just the path where it's you purely as an artist you could also be a producer you could also like the music industry is infinite the film industry is infinite the artistic industry is infinite I know friends who are artists who are now curators you know I know friends who were artists uh in music who are now producers or Studio managers or um you know help produce stuff for film and television right like there are different ways in different uh Pathways that are different unique

00:45:21	intersections as people can find a home um in in that creative field and so I think think about your intersections think about the things that make you unique for me it's my multiculturalism it's it's the way that I view the world it's my art history background mixed with um you know the things that I grew up with and those things put me in a position where I was a great brain consultant and I was a great you know uh in a great position to help lead creative teams maybe others have different skill sets and different

00:45:49	intersections that position them really well for things that they may never have considered before so I think also just breaking out of the box and allowing other options to show themselves to you as well in the words of DJ Khaled another one another one it's been a pleasure bro uh uh you're you're a wealth of knowledge I feel in the future that we'll we'll probably have to do a part two because it's just so much that I think you have to unpack um to unpack but uh where can people find gumbo uh media on social platforms

00:46:24	and how can they type in yeah well first of all I appreciate it uh absolutely game for Game for uh V2 whenever uh but yeah people can find gumbo um the easiest places online I mean it's gumbelmedia.com um at gumbo media on Instagram um gumbo fit is on our gumbo media website that's also being flipped so depending on what people see it the website will be different soon as well um I think those are probably the easiest places and you can really be pinpointed anywhere else you need to go within the gumbo ecosystem from there

00:46:56	love it my pleasure bro thank you make sure you guys like subscribe comment below and let Matthew know um your thoughts on this uh this podcast
