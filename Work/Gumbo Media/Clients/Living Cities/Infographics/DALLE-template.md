*Recieves generated design request from client*

Client: This a good start. Lets focus on 3 cells at a time so that they are all accurately illustrative of the concepts. We'll start with 1-3, then we'll do 4-6, then 7-9. I will provide more detailed feedback on each cell as we go along. The first 3 are:

1. Equitable Small Business Opportunities and Infrastructure/Climate Investments: Illustrate this concept with symbols that represent growth, community, and sustainability.

2. Key Elements for Success: Use imagery of engagement, communication, and support, with a focus on clarity and protection.

3. Creating High-Road Jobs: Depict strong alignment between policies, infrastructure, and job quality.
