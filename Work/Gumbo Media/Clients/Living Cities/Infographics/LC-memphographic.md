# Design Request: Living Cities Memphographic Illustrations

**Objective:** Create a series of flat illustrations in the "Memphographic" style (Corporate Memphis + Infographics) that adheres closely to the Living Cities brand guidelines and reference graphic provided.

**Color Palette:** Strictly use the colors identified in the Living Cities brand guidelines. The primary colors are Evergreen, Turquoise, Amber, and Rust. Please ensure that these colors are used prominently and consistently across all illustrations. Any additional colors introduced should complement this palette.

## Visual Elements:

- Maintain the minimalist aesthetic with clean, flat shapes and lines as seen in the reference graphic.

- Incorporate icons and symbols that are in harmony with those used in the Living Cities reference material, ensuring continuity across the series.

- Typography should be consistent with the brand guidelines, using [insert specific fonts] for any text elements.

## Concepts to Illustrate:

...

## Layout Instructions:

- The illustrations should be within a square frame divided into equal sections for each concept, with clear visual separation while maintaining a unified look across the entire series.

- Consider a grid layout that allows each concept to stand alone but also contributes to a cohesive whole when the illustrations are viewed together.

## Additional Notes:

- The illustrations should capture the essence of the Living Cities mission, which is to foster an inclusive and equitable society.

- Avoid any imagery that could be construed as exclusionary or not representative of the diversity and inclusivity goals of Living Cities.

- The illustrations should be simple and easy to understand, with a focus on clarity, functionality, and accessibility.

- The illustrations should favor symbols and icons over text. All text will be embedded by me in the final design, so PLEASE LEAVE AMPLE SPACE FOR TEXT.
