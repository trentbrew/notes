Recap of Needs
July 2024

Addition of Online Resource Portal:
The build-out of an additional section under website resources to share with unique community users, mimicking the back-end access and core functionality of the existing DISC + SEO curriculum.
Reorganizing and renaming ‚ÄúResources‚Äù tab sub-navigation.

Website Edits:
General:
Naming conventions: Simplify and keep consistent: "Get In Touch" changed to "Contact Us."
"Get Started" changed to "Intake Form." Or something else consistent and clear.
Home Page:
Replace Banners with NewRoot colors and our staff in the tree on the right of banners with high quality photos of our work (Workshops, Student Day of Action, Gala). Captions under each. Buttons corresponding for each photo "Contact us to learn more," "Learn more on how you can sponsor the Gala," "Want to join us for the next Student Day of Action. Click here to learn more," etc.
Delete "noise" (ie. Wellness. Impact. Growth. on the landing page).
Add simplified and minimalist version of Services Page.
"Who do we serve?" (keep headlines and icons, delete most of the text).
Add Chicagoland and where. Add partners.
Add Impact #s using the % from newroot.org/careers.

Hello team üëãüèæ,

Thank you for the introduction, @Matthew Manning. I'll be on the lookout for the WordPress login information. Please feel free to add any additional information to the portal as needed, and I'll be here to answer any questions you may have.

Looking forward to working with you all, and have a great weekend!

Hello NewRoot team,

Just wanted to check in and see if there has been any progress on adding the WordPress login information to the document. This will allow me to complete the website audit ahead of our kick-off. I'm available anytime next week to discuss in more detail if needed.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Best,
Trent Brew

Thanks,

Hi Trent,

Let us know if you have any trouble with the login. When would be a good time for you to connect with our team?

Thanks!

Good morning, Team!

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for the login details. I've successfully accessed three of the four accounts. We're just one step away with the Network Solutions account, which seems to need a verification code (I've attached a screenshot for clarity).

Understanding how busy everyone must be, I want to assure you there's no rush on this. When you have a moment, perhaps we could touch base via a brief call to wrap up the details and discuss any additional information you might want to share? I'm flexible with timing and can adapt to whatever works best for you this week after 11am CT.

I'm available from tomorrow onwards, anytime after 11am CT throughout this week. Please let me know a time that suits you best. Also, would you prefer that we discuss further details over the call before I commence the website updates, or should I proceed with the preliminary changes in the meantime?

Warm regards,
Trent Brew

Hey
@Trent Brew
! How's everything going across your projects and the deliverables listed above? Thanks for your support with communications while I was away. It helped me disconnect and get the time away I needed.

Good morning!

So glad to hear it :pray::skin-tone-5: I hope the ease back in is a

Here is a quick breakdown of the progress on everything:

Erin D Chapman
I completed and sent over the four squarespace template treatments for Erin's review. I had to invite her separately to each one to be able to view them, and just sent them to hello@gumbomedia.com as well. Looking forward to your thoughts on the overall direction.

Bronzeville Blues
The latest site can be found here: https://bronzeville-blues-prototype.webflow.io/
All of the updates requested by Jushua have been made (still needing to send update via email). I'd still like to experiment with more color and personality in the design.

Gumbo Site
It's coming along swell((: I'll send over a link here shortly. I have lots of thoughts on the logo, maybe best to discuss that during our next sync.

NewRoot Online Resource Portal
I have an email drafted for the NewRoot team proposing a call this week to get aligned on any additional needs prior to completing the website updates. They should be pretty straightforward to implement but wanted to check in with you first.
I was able to access 3 of 4 accounts successfully but I figure we can verify everything in real-time.
I'm a bit worried that my asking for the info so hastily may have been abrupt and I hope the team doesn't feel rushed. Let me know how you'd like to proceed.
