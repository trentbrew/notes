Hello Team,

Thank you for the detailed feedback! I've made the updates and have included screenshots of the changes below.

1. **Resource titles font**: The font of the top titles to be aligned with the SEL Resource folders - Poppins.
  - ✅ Done
2. **Culture + Climate Student Survey**: Replace with this version.
  - ✅ Done
3. **Photo on Toolkit page**: Resized and brought to the top to match what it looks like on the DISC site - should stay at the top and not move with the page as you scroll.
  - ✅ Done
4. **Top resource carrots**: Are we able to make the top resource carrots collapsible? It looks like the carrot subfolders in the SEL curriculum are collapsible.
  - ❌ Due to the limitations of WordPress, it will be difficult to make the top resource carrots collapsible without access to the underlying JavaScript inside the WPBakery components. It is possible as long as the the contents is only plain text which is why the SEL dropdowns are collapsible.
5. **Download buttons**: The download buttons for the SEL Resource subfolders and the rest of the download buttons are different. Can we please align to mirror the SEL Resource subfolders? That's also the font we'd like the tile titles to be as well.
  - ❌ For the reason above, the only way to make the download buttons the same is for the top resources to be plain text links instead of buttons. If we were to do that, we'd have to find another solution for the nested resources since the inner-dropdown is a component and not plain text. This would involve rebuilding & redesigning the nested resources from scratch. If this is something you'd like to move forward with, let me know and I can provide more information on how to proceed.
6. **Conflict-Resolution zip files**: Issue with having to unzip the folder to access files. The other folders aren't like that.
  - ❌ Unfortunately, we cannot control the behavior of the zip files after they are downloaded. The way zip files are handled can vary based on the browser and operating system being used.

7. **Login page**: It looks like the login page is misaligned. I'll include a screencap.
  - ✅ Done
