# Introduction & Summary

NewRoot Learning Institute is a national social impact organization focused on transforming education and community spaces. They specialize in building deep social-emotional learning (SEL) skills in educators to change how young people experience school and how schools serve society.

For over 20 years, NewRoot has been a partner for high schools, districts, and organizations, ensuring students graduate equipped for college, career, and life success.

# Project Background

Over the past year, NewRoot has faced significant technical challenges with their WordPress website, including outages, slow load times, and critical functionality issues affecting their donation page. As their technical partner, Gumbo Media has provided ongoing support to address these concerns while implementing new features that have enhanced their digital presence. Through this collaboration, we've gained deep insight into NewRoot's technical infrastructure and operational needs. To future-proof their platform and better serve their mission, we propose migrating their website from WordPress to Webflow. This strategic shift will not only resolve their current technical pain points but also deliver a more secure, responsive, and user-friendly experience that properly reflects NewRoot's growth and impact in the education sector. The migration represents a crucial step in modernizing their digital infrastructure to support their continued expansion and better serve their community of educators and partners.

# Needs from Client

## Required Access & Credentials

To ensure a smooth migration from WordPress to Webflow, we require secure access to the following systems and credentials. All credentials will be handled with strict confidentiality and documented in a shared password manager. Services that have not been granted access will be marked with a `[ ]` and will be required to be granted access during the migration process.

  - Required for: Exporting content, media, and files
  - Migrates to Webflow CMS
- [x] **OpalStack:** Current hosting control panel access
  - Required for: Deactivating hosting services pre-launch

  - No migration required

## Core Integrations

- [x] **MemberPress:** administrative access
  - Required for: member data export, subscription structures, automated communications
  - Migrates to Webflow CMS
    > NOTE: Member management is a critical component of the migration. We will need to work closely with NewRoot to ensure that all member data is exported and migrated to Webflow CMS with little to no disruption to their operations or user experience.

  - Required for: API access & Webflow integration
  - No migration required

# Appendix

## Communication

**Cadence:**

- Weekly status meetings every Tuesday at 10am EST via Zoom
- Bi-weekly stakeholder reviews every other Thursday at 2pm EST
- Ad-hoc meetings scheduled with 24-hour notice when needed

<!-- TODO: Check with Austin on cadence -->

**Channels:**

- Primary: Slack channel #newroot-x-gumbo
- Secondary: Email for formal documentation and approvals

## Prerequisites & Assumptions

**Assumptions:**

- Client will provide all content assets by agreed milestone dates
- Current WordPress site remains stable during migration period
- Client has necessary access to domain and hosting credentials
- Third-party integrations (Eventbrite, WooCommerce) remain compatible
- Content freeze will be strictly observed during final migration

**Dependencies:**

- Webflow Enterprise account activation
- SSL certificate installation
- DNS access and configuration rights
- Third-party API keys and credentials
- Content delivery from NewRoot team
- Stakeholder availability for training sessions

## Open Questions:

- **Membership Transition**:
    - The current setup in WordPress uses **MemberPress** to manage access to exclusive resources and training materials.
    - Webflow has limited native membership functionality, so we’ll need to supplement it with a third-party tool like **MemberStack** or **MemberSpace**.
- **Active Members During Transition**:
    - How do we handle **active memberships** during the migration?
    - We may need to securely export/import user data and notify members in advance about any potential disruption.
    - In case of disruption, we will need to work with NewRoot to ensure that members are notified and their access is restored as soon as possible. A newsletter service like Brevo or Mailchimp will be most effective for sending out these alerts.
- **User Experience Post-Migration**:
    - What level of access control does NewRoot need moving forward? For example, will they need tiered memberships or specific access to content?
    - Are there any automated communications (e.g., renewal notices) tied to the current system that we need to replicate in Webflow?
- **Data Integrity**:
    - Ensuring member data (e.g., payment history, subscription details) migrates accurately is critical. What’s our fallback plan if certain data formats don’t transfer seamlessly?

# Community Care Clause

In all projects, Gumbo Media offers an umbrella for either or both teams to hold time as needed (within reason) for grief, sorrow, self-love, joy, and rejuvenation amidst a rapidly changing and often tumultuous world, particularly for a team passionate about the liberation of oppressed populations. In the instance that Gumbo or our partner would want or need to activate the Community Care Clause, Gumbo reserves the right to add up to 2 weeks to the working timeline to account for human moments that necessitate pause or temporary absences from teammates due to illness, mental health, or any of the reasons aforementioned.
