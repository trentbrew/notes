Hey Matthew,

I want to sincerely apologize for missing our scheduled call today. It's an oversight that I do not take lightly as the sole designer on the project and I'm committed to ensuring it doesn't happen again.

I'm fully on board with the outlined steps and plan moving forward, and I appreciate your flexibility and the effort to keep the project moving smoothly. I will prioritize drafting the document that captures all findings and notes related to the workplan items and ensure this is completed by EOD Monday for your review.

Thursday between 11-1p PT works best for me. I believe this will give us ample time to thoroughly discuss and plan the necessary actions for the web-focused items.

Please let me know if thereâ€™s anything more I can do or any further information I can provide in the meantime.

Thank you for your understanding and for guiding the project forward.

Best regards,
Trent
