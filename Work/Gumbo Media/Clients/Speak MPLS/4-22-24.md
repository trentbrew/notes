Hey Matthew, I hope you had. I wanted to share some updates regarding my travel plans and our project deliverables:

# Travel

I'm currently in California helping my parents move and will be heading to St. Louis this afternoon. It's a 26hr drive so there's a chance I'll be a bit slow to respond over the next few days. I don't mind taking our call with Rebecca while I'm on the road but let me know what you think.

# Speak MPLS

- The embedded instagram feed has been added to the current site (https://speakmpls-com.webflow.io/) as well as the alternate design (https://speakmpls2.webflow.io/). I was able to remove the watermarks using custom CSS & am happy to make any further tweaks. Looking forward to your thoughts on the overall design direction.

# Elaine Wackerly

- I'll be finalizing brand v2 this morning and during the trip. I think the 24th is still doable.
- Will we be using the same slide deck to present the new brand direction? Also, is there a specific set of deliverables you'd like to see for this round?

# Bronzeville Blues

- Thank you again for helping me get access to the archive. I'm aiming to have the organization diagram/design completed by Friday. I'll keep you updated on my progress.

# Docket.tv

- I went ahead & setup a free GitHub team account for Gumbo which is where the source code for Docket will be stored. I sent an invite to 'hello@gumbomedia.com' so you should be able to access it here: https://github.com/Gumbo-Media/docket.tv. Also, the production URL is now https://app.docket.tv rather than the vercel link.
- I saw that Rebecca asked for the slide deck from our last meeting. I made some slight edits to the copy & design(https://www.canva.com/design/DAGBrdZfVxE/vw1YUe_iwEu00oj5gicG4Q/edit) but no worries if you already sent it over.

I hope this stand-up-esque format is helpful. Let me know if you'd like me to continue sharing updates in this way or if you'd prefer a different approach üôèüèæ
