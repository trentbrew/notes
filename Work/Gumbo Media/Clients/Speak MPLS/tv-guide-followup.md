Good morning Rebecca,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to follow up on our conversation last week regarding the TV Guide UI for Speak MPLS.

As we discussed, integrating the custom TV Guide with the cablecast API will be a crucial component of the project. Based on my research I can confirm that access to the API comes with the purchase of the cablecast system and does not cost extra. This integration will ensure a dynamic and user-friendly interface for viewers to easily navigate through the programming schedule. I understand that Nate is the key contact for information and access related to the backend and the Cablecast API.

Could we possibly arrange a call with Nate at your earliest convenience? My aim for this meeting is to discuss the technical details and secure the necessary API access to move forward with the development process. I'm flexible with my schedule and will accommodate whatever time works best for Nate.

I've also been working on some initial mockups and would love to share them with you and Nate during the call.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Good morning, Rebecca,

I hope this message finds you well. Following our discussion last week about the TV Guide UI development for SPEAK MPLS, I've conducted further research regarding the integration with the Cablecast API. I'm pleased to confirm that access to the API is included with the purchase of the Cablecast system, without any additional costs. This integration is pivotal for creating a dynamic, user-friendly interface that allows viewers to effortlessly explore the programming schedule.

To advance this aspect of our project, could we organize a meeting with Nate, who I understand is the primary contact for backend information and Cablecast API access? I'm eager to discuss the technical requirements and ensure we have the necessary API access to proceed with the development. My schedule is flexible, and I'll make arrangements to accommodate the time that's most convenient for Nate.

Additionally, I've prepared some initial mockups of the UI that I'm excited to share and discuss with both of you during our call.

I look forward to your reply and setting up the meeting at your earliest convenience.

Best regards,

Trent
