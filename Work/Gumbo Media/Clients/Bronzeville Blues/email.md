Good morning Team,

I wanted to give you a quick update on the calendar integration. For those unfamiliar, Notion is a versatile workspace tool that combines note-taking, task management, databases, and calendars into one interface. This makes it an excellent choice for collaborative projects and event management.

Given its capabilities, we’ve decided to move forward with a Notion + Zapier solution. This setup will allow all organizations to log in to a single Notion account to manage their events. These events will then automatically sync with the Webflow CMS and update the website in real-time.

I’ve already set up the Notion account and sent invites to each of you. Could you confirm that you’ve received them and are able to access the Notion page? The integration is currently up and running, but there are a few small bugs I’m working on ironing out. I’ll make sure everything is stable, and I’ll send a comprehensive guide on how to use the Notion page by tomorrow end of day.

Thank you all for your patience as we finalize the last few details! Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions in the meantime.

Best,
Trent Brew
