Thanks, Diamond –



That makes sense. I’ll defer to Trent on any instincts there, as well as whether or not a final call feels helpful to complete this work.



It may be Monday before another email comes through. Either way, we’ll get it sorted out for you ASAP, I hope all enjoy their weekend.

Hi Matthew!



Thanks for following up. We want to make sure that whichever implementation that does not require each organization to have their own login to the website, that that’s the route we go. I would rather have the feeds come from everyone else’s website into the main website versus each organization having their own login into the website and having the onus of manually updating.



Please let me know if this makes sense. We can also set up a call if necessary to go over final details and begin to close out this project.



Thanks so much for your patience and your direction.

Hey Joshua and team –



I hope you are doing well! Happy fall. Just checking in on website feedback and any responses to Trent’s last few messages, including the email threads below. We’d like to have this site wrapped this month, as we won’t be able to extend our team’s capacity beyond it.



Have you been able to review the latest version of the site we sent over? And do you have any questions about what Trent shared re: the development process, and/or his response to your inquiries about a calendar solution?



I will let Trent follow-up with any additional context or next steps, but you’ll find his last message repasted immediately below, and the longer exchange between Joshua and Trent below it, which should provide context on where we are in the process.



Hello Team,



It's great to connect with you, @Diamond Dixon



@Joshua I want to clarify that both the Zapier integration, and the full-stack custom option will be provided pro bono. There will be no additional costs involved, and the project's scope, including the allocated resources, will remain as initially agreed upon.



For a quick and efficient solution, I recommend we proceed with the Zapier integration. However, I also want to outline the implications of each choice clearly:



The development of the custom full-stack app represents a strategic exploration into the market need for federated-calendar solution, as identified through our collaboration with Bronzeville Blues Collaborative. Gumbo would design, develop, maintain, and potentially scale this custom solution, leveraging Bronzeville Blues as a critical test-case to provide feedback and validation. On the other hand, the Zapier integration serves as a short-term solution to meet immediate needs. If you're interested in discussing the full-stack option further, I'm ready to draft a detailed proposal that outlines potential features, the development process, and a timeline.



In either case, I can initiate the Zapier integration right away. I'll just need the previously mentioned information from each organization to proceed.



Please let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification. I'm happy to make any additional changes to the website as well in the meantime as we prepare for launch.



Looking forward to your thoughts!



Best,

Trent

Hello Joshua,

Thank you for your feedback. I do believe integrating Zapier automations into each of the organization's pipelines would be a good solution. This way, each organization can manage their events independently, and the changes will be automatically reflected on the website.

In order to effectively implement Zapier into the Webflow site, I will need a few things from each of the organizations:

A comprehensive list of the tools currently used for event management, along with the login credentials for their calendars.
Their current workflow for event updates and any platform-specific integrations they already employ.
Login credentials for each of the organizations' calendars will be needed when we're ready to implement the automations.
Let me know if you're able to provide this information, and I can start working on the integration. More information on how Zapier integrates with Webflow can be found here:

Documentation: https://university.webflow.com/lesson/integrate-zapier?
Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwxfoukJ8PA
Zapier Pricing: https://zapier.com/app/planbuilder/plans


Regarding the full-stack custom solution as an alternative, there are several advantages to this approach that may be worth considering:

Compatability with Zapier: By integrating Zapier with a custom frontend, we can leverage the best of both worlds—automating event data collection while providing a tailored user experience. This setup allows us to use Zapier's powerful automation capabilities to fetch and update event data automatically from various platforms, which can then be displayed through a custom interface designed specifically for the needs of each organization.
Flexibility: We can design the user interface to match the existing aesthetic of our website seamlessly and integrate more deeply with our current systems.
Tailored Features: We can implement custom features such as advanced filtering, user-specific notifications, and more sophisticated data analytics, which are often limited in off-the-shelf solutions.
Security: Owning the codebase gives us control over data security and privacy, crucial for user trust and compliance with regulations.
Reliability: 3rd party service outages or discontinuations can be avoided by using a custom solution.
Cost-Effective: We can avoid the ongoing costs and service terms that can occur with third-party services.
A custom solution could provide a more robust and sustainable framework for event management needs in the long run. If you agree, I would be happy to draft a more detailed proposal outlining the potential features, estimated costs, and development timeline.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,
Trent

Hey Joshua,

Thank you for your for the in-depth feedback. Here's a quick update on the progress with the Bronzeville Collaborative website:

Red Screen Issue:
I noticed the red screen issue on the website as well, but strangely enough it's only happening when I use Microsoft Edge. All other browsers seem to render the site as expected.
I've submitted a ticket to Microsoft to remove the flag from the site. I'm not sure why the site was flagged as this issue occurred this morning before I transferred the site and changed the URL, but as I tested the site just now it seems to be resolved. Let me know if you're able to confirm this.
Events Section:
I've updated the events section to display the 5 events. I made a quick placeholder thumbnail for TBD events and grabbed the other event images from their respective websites. Let me know your thoughts.
Event Update Feasibility:
I wasn't able to find a quick Webflow Plugin for this, but there are a few options for a bespoke solution for a federated calendar if you would be interested in exploring that route. It would involve some custom coding but I think it could be a good starting point for a tailored solution. Here are a few options:
Google Calendars: Embed multiple Google Calendars into a single view for simplicity. This would sacrifice the design of the events section and would instead rely on an embeded monthly calendar.
ScheduleX: ScheduleX is an opensource calendar component that can be either embeded into a website, or used as a source-of-truth for a more robust integration that allows us to retain the current design while automating updates.
Zapier: Automate event fetching to streamline updates without manual intervention.
Calendar Aggregators: We could consider services like Teamup or Time.ly for comprehensive calendar management. However, this would not be as customizable as the other options.
I think Zapier could be a great option, allowing many users to automatically funnel their events into a single document, but I would also be open to discussing a full-stack custom solution. We've recently built a similar tool for a client and I think it would be a good starting point. I can provide more details if you'd like to discuss further.

Looking forward to your thoughts and feedback!

Hello Trent,



Thank you for the update, I just have a few critiques. When I first loaded into the website, and when I tried switching to different tabs of the website, I got this red screen. I don't know why I'm getting this for this website and not the last one, but I just wanted to be sure this wouldn't have an affect on the actual website when it's up. Secondly, when I was on the history page and put my cursor over the blue history button, it switches to "Hisotry". Additionally, I see that you put the text:



"The Brownsville Blues Collaborative stands as a virtuous initiative, championed by a coalition of esteemed organizations (could turn the word "organizations" into a link to the organizations page here). Its mission is to preserve and promote the rich heritage of blues music and the cultural legacy of the historic Bronzeville neighborhood. Through a series of dedicated events and educational programs, the Collaborative endeavors to honor and perpetuate the enduring spirit of this iconic community."



In the organizations tab, but could you put this text on Home page under the sliding panel of logos instead, and put "The Bronzeville Blues Collaborative is dedicated to preserving and promoting the rich blues music heritage and cultural legacy of the historic Bronzeville neighborhood through events, and education." under the sliding panels on the organizations page. So basically, swap these two texts please. Lastly, I see that there are only 3 events on the events tab, could you create 2 more for CPAH and Haven Studio. Also please update the events section as such:

Event details:
Build Bronzeville's Event: Fresh Moves Mobile Market  at Boxville Thursday, July 25, 2024 1:30 PM - 3:00 PM Boxville, 330 East 51st Street, Chicago, IL, 60615
Chicago Blues Revival's Event: Nick Alexander , August 9th , 2024 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM Burnside Park, 9400 S. Greenwood Ave, Chicago, IL
CPAG: TBD
Haven Studio: TBD
Muddy Waters Mojo Museum: Women In Blues & Front Porch Performance Saturday, August 10, 2024 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM 4339 S Lake Park Ave, Chicago, IL, 60653
and on this topic, did you look into the feasibility of each organization updating their own slot for the events tab on this page?



Best,



Joshua Mustapha

Good morning Team,

Thanks so much for your patience as we work through the details of the calendar integration.

Our team has decided to proceed with a combination of Zapier and Notion, as this allows us to setup a federated calendar that can be accessed by all organizations with a single login.

Here's how it will work:

1. We will setup a Notion account and provide the login credentials to each organization.
2. Each organization will be able to add their events to the Notion calendar.
3. The events will then be automatically reflected on the website.

We will also setup the Zapier integration to automatically fetch the events from the Notion calendar and update the website.

Hello Trent,

You can excuse the previous email I just sent. I have a few requests and some additional information that needs to be filled in on the blank sections of the Bronzeville Collaborative website. I noticed on the website the sliding panel of rotating logos, Chicago Blues Revival's logo is not featured so please be sure to add that at your soonest convenience. Additionally, and given that our Collaborative explanation is right below, the sliding panel of organization logos, could you update the previous sentence to this:

"The Brownsville Blues Collaborative stands as a virtuous initiative, championed by a coalition of esteemed organizations (could turn the word "organizations" into a link to the organizations page here). Its mission is to preserve and promote the rich heritage of blues music and the cultural legacy of the historic Bronzeville neighborhood. Through a series of dedicated events and educational programs, the Collaborative endeavors to honor and perpetuate the enduring spirit of this iconic community."

For the Events section, could we create one more event section so that we have 5 total. This will allow each of the organizations to have their most upcoming event be shown, additionally, add a link to each organizations calendar page in each of their individual event sections so that users can see their entire schedules on their websites:

Who are the members?:
The members include The Bronzeville Incubator, Boxville, Bronzeville Cookin’, The Forum, and Engage Bronzeville., Chicago Blues Revival, Chicago Public Art Group, Haven Studio, The Muddy Waters Mojo Museum, and The Vandercook College One City Program.

Why is Bronzeville important to the blues?:
Bronzeville has been the vibrant heart of Chicago's blues scene since the 1910s, a musical oasis born from the Great Migration when African Americans brought the soulful sounds of the blues to the city. This legendary neighborhood has hosted an array of iconic blues musicians and renowned clubs, creating a cultural mecca that pulsates with rhythm and history. Imagine the electrifying performances of Muddy Waters, Sam Cooke, Buddy Guy, Otis Rush, Nat King Cole, and Louis Armstrong lighting up venues like the Checkerboard Lounge, Pepper’s Lounge, Theresa’s Lounge, and the 708 Club. In Bronzeville, the blues aren't just music; they're a way of life, an indelible part of the community's history.

Where can I see live blues in Bronzeville?:
Although there are no blues clubs currently operating in Bronzeville, several members of this collaborative keep the legacy going by hosting blues shows.

Where can I see historic blues sights in Bronzeville?:
The best-preserved landmarks include the Muddy Waters House, Louis Armstrong House, Nat King Cole House, and the vibrant Blues Travels Fast mural. Sadly, some historic buildings remain unmarked, and others, like the Checkerboard Lounge and Pepper’s Lounge, have been torn down.

How can I support the cause?:
Visit our Contact tab and head to the Volunteer section, where you can provide your name, phone number, email address, and additional details about your support ideas.

After these adjustments, the website should be good to go. One last question I had was if there was a way for each organization to be able to edit their most upcoming event in the Events section?

Best,

Joshua

Hi Diamond –

Hope you are well! And pleasure to meet you, Joshua. Yes, Monday 7/15 is fine for feedback. That said, I am out on vacation all next week, so I am connecting Trent Brew here, our web designer for the project.

Joshua, when you provide feedback, please send it to Trent direction (and keep me cc’d for future reference). He’ll be able to meet your feedback along with any questions or inquiries. We have some of our own edits we’re implementing as well, including more color and dynamism throughout the site.

Beyond that, we’ll await your feedback.

Thanks, all!

Thank you so much for your time and patience throughout this process. I'm adding in our Software and Website intern, Joshua, to the email chain so that he can help finalize the edits on the Bronzeville Blues Collaborative website.

Can you give us until Monday, 7/15 to go over everything once more? I want to review the notes again and the site as is, so that we can get your team whatever is needed by Monday.

Thank you!

We’ll proceed with our final edits (including adding some color and dynamic elements) once you’re ready.

Thanks so much, and hope you have a beautiful week.

Hi Jennifer and Diamond –

I hope you both are well. You’ll find the updated BBC website here, which includes a scrolling reel of the logos, and a new, separate “Collaborative” page with descriptions of each. At this point, it’s really just a matter of rounding out content, adding a bit of color, and replacing any images or videos you want.

Are you able to review and let me know what you’d like edited? From there, we can finalize and launch the site.

Thanks so much. I’ll be available for any questions as you need me.

Hi Matthew,

This looks good, I just want to double check and correct the names associated with each group (for instance, I know ours has changed). Also, let me check to see if the Chicago Public Art Group is still involved. But this is a good thing to start with and definitely makes it easier on me!

Hopefully I caught you in time. I did some digging and came across an archived folder with more BBC info and materials, including THIS doc with org descriptions, and an accompanying folder with logo assets. In short, here’s the list.

Build Bronzeville
Chicago Blues Revival
Chicago Public Art Group (CPAG)
Haven Studio
MOJO Museum

All this to say, we have some of the orgs, but please add to/edit the doc as necessary to make sure this includes all orgs and is the most up to date info. Should save you some time, though!

We’re working on an update for you and should have it to share back by the end of next week. In the meantime, if you can send along those short descriptions/bios for each org in the collective, that will be very helpful. No other questions at this time, but I propose we share the next iteration in the form of a presentation with the designer so we can go through all the granular details and chronicle any final notes prior to a V3 delivery.

Let me know your thoughts when you have a moment. Enjoy your Friday and weekend!

Thanks so much for the feedback and thoughts. Just checking in to note that I’ve relayed all this to our designer and will confirm any needs. That said, at a baseline, the short description for each org would be really valuable, as well as the collaborative statement. I’m assessing with Trent (designer) if a meeting is necessary. There may well be a request to sync for a quick 30 mins later this week or early next to hash out any final questions or details as we prepare for a more robust V2.

Thank you so much, and more coming your way soon!

Hello,

Sorry this took so long. Overall I like the look and flow of the site and I do like the ideas in the site outline. I feel like I need to give you more photos/images. The only thing right now that I have a concern with is that I would like it to be a little more clear that we are multiple organizations who work together under one umbrella--the Bronzeville Blues Collaborative. Maybe if each of our logos (with links) were visible right away that would be clearer? Do you need me to write out short descriptions/bios for each organization, then one for the collaborative overall?

Happy to meet with you anytime and I will be more responsive moving forward so we can get this completed.

If it helps, feel free to text me at 773-368-4644 when you need me to look at something or have a question. I don't mind that at all.

Hi Jennifer and Diamond –

You’ll see V1 of the site in the link below.

https://bronzeville-blues-prototype.webflow.io/

Please note, there is yet lots of room for improvement, and several details not finalized. These include:

Site copy (some of it is still from the original template or generalized placeholder)
Deeper infusion of brand colors.
Some brighter and higher resolution imagery.
Some small moments of dynamism throughout.

However, this should lay out the core foundations of the website and broader user experience. Please click through every page and let us know what feedback you have as we begin to now populate and finalize the site over the next couple of iterations.

You can place all feedback for the site at the bottom of the original Site Map doc HERE. Upon receipt of feedback, I’ll also structure a doc for V2 where we can place all ideal site copy to finalize the customization of the user experience.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Emails now coming through (hooray!). All of that sounds good. We have enough visually and conceptually to at least build out the Resources and Collaborative pages as a base level. But looking forward to getting more clarity on how you anticipate those functioning once launched.

For now, I have Trent trucking along on design. I will loop back next week with an updated timeline on drafts and delivery.

Many thanks, and hope you two are having a great week.

Hi Matthew!

Thanks so much for this rundown below. I have went over the notes that you linked in the site map and it looks like everything we discussed is there. Those points are still on par for what we are looking for as far as site arrangement. To your point, there were some items that I felt like were a bit dated and could use an upgraded version of those same logos/characters/photos, etc. I am touching base with Jennifer right now, as she will be the final reviewer and commenter for what we need moving forward. We still need to discuss the resources and collaborative tabs but I will discuss with Jennifer first quickly and she will be the one to make the deciding/final call on the aesthetics and arrangement. Stay tuned! Thanks very much for all of your help!

Hi Diamond –

Following up here with a link to the updated Site Map, which pulls together all previous thoughts and new thoughts across discovery calls from both development windows. Please note with comments what you’d like removed. I’d also like to see some additional thoughts around what will be on “The Collaborative” tab, as that currently feels the most ambiguous. “Resources” is another one that could use some additional clarity.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DaVeDvWsyPwPqZGSwXJXLdQpOfyfj0f4BSAsIPwduB0/edit?usp=sharing

Let me know when those thoughts have been added and I’ll relay over to our dev team. In the meantime, they know to be building out the base.

Additional question, did all of the images and assets look good? Are they still aligned? And finally, are there any more we can add? If so, please drop those images HERE.

Thanks, and let me know if you have any questions!

Hi team!

It turns out your message, Diamond, went to spam. I’ve told Trent to hold any work as I’ve been awaiting responses from my previous two messages on sitemap feedback. But it turns out the message you sent just never arrived in my inbox. Not sure why that happened, but I saw some other client communications in there as well and have since rectified the issue. Thank you for the follow-up and email response snapshot, as it helped me identify your original response in spam.

I will have Trent (from Gumbo’s dev team) hop back into building out the site per our site map. @Diamond, I’m hopping into a meeting in the coming minute but will follow-up afterwards with a doc where you can deliver any preferred updates on content and threads to remove.

Thanks so much, and more soon. Sorry again for this mishap—quite frustrated that so many client comms across 3 projects have been filtered to spam.

Hey Joshua,

Hope you had a great weekend!

The site has been updated with the latest changes, and can be found at the following URL: https://bronzevilleblues.webflow.io.

Let me know your thoughts and feedback. When you're ready I can also go ahead and connect the official domain to the site as well.

Happy to make any updates as needed in the interim.

# Joshua's response to Trent

Hello Trent,

Thank you for the update, I just have a few critiques. When I first loaded into the website, and when I tried switching to different tabs of the website, I got this red screen. I don't know why I'm getting this for this website and not the last one, but I just wanted to be sure this wouldn't have an affect on the actual website when it's up. Secondly, when I was on the history page and put my cursor over the blue history button, it switches to "Hisotry". Additionally, I see that you put the text:

"The Brownsville Blues Collaborative stands as a virtuous initiative, championed by a coalition of esteemed organizations (could turn the word "organizations" into a link to the organizations page here). Its mission is to preserve and promote the rich heritage of blues music and the cultural legacy of the historic Bronzeville neighborhood. Through a series of dedicated events and educational programs, the Collaborative endeavors to honor and perpetuate the enduring spirit of this iconic community."

In the organizations tab, but could you put this text on Home page under the sliding panel of logos instead, and put "The Bronzeville Blues Collaborative is dedicated to preserving and promoting the rich blues music heritage and cultural legacy of the historic Bronzeville neighborhood through events, and education." under the sliding panels on the organizations page. So basically, swap these two texts please. Lastly, I see that there are only 3 events on the events tab, could you create 2 more for CPAH and Haven Studio. Also please update the events section as such:
Event details:
Build Bronzeville's Event: Fresh Moves Mobile Market at Boxville Thursday, July 25, 2024 1:30 PM - 3:00 PM Boxville, 330 East 51st Street, Chicago, IL, 60615
Chicago Blues Revival's Event: Nick Alexander , August 9th , 2024 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM Burnside Park, 9400 S. Greenwood Ave, Chicago, IL
CPAG: TBD
Haven Studio: TBD
Muddy Waters Mojo Museum: Women In Blues & Front Porch Performance Saturday, August 10, 2024 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM 4339 S Lake Park Ave, Chicago, IL, 60653
and on this topic, did you look into the feasibility of each organization updating their own slot for the events tab on this page?

Best,

Joshua Mustapha

# Trent's response to Joshua

Sure thing, Trent! Here's a draft for your message to Joshua:

Hey Joshua,

Thank you for your for the in-depth feedback. Here's a quick update on the progress with the Bronzeville Collaborative website:

1. **Red Screen Issue:**

   - I noticed the red screen issue on the website as well, but strangely enough it's only happening when I use Microsoft Edge. All other browsers seem to render the site as expected.
   - I've submitted a ticket to Microsoft to remove the flag from the site. I'm not sure why the site was flagged as this issue occurred this morning before I transferred the site and changed the URL, but as I test the site right now it seems to be resolved. Let me know if you're able to confirm this.

2. **Typo Correction:**

   - The typo on the History page ("Hisotry" instead of "History") has been fixed.

3. **Text Swap:**

   - The text from the Organizations tab has been moved to the Home page under the sliding panel of logos.
   - The current Home page text has been moved to the Organizations page under the sliding panels.

4. **Events Section:**

   - Two new events have been created for CPAH and Haven Studio (both marked as TBD).
   - Event details have been updated as follows:
     - **Build Bronzeville's Event:** Fresh Moves Mobile Market at Boxville, Thursday, July 25, 2024, 1:30 PM - 3:00 PM, Boxville, 330 East 51st Street, Chicago, IL, 60615

5. **Event Update Feasibility:**

I wasn't able to find a quick Webflow Plugin for this, but there are a few options for a bespoke solution for a federated calendar if you would be interested in exploring that route. It would involve some custom coding but I think it could be a good starting point for a tailored solution. Here are a few options:

- **Google Calendars:** Embed multiple Google Calendars into a single view for simplicity. This would sacrifice the design of the events section and would instead rely on an embeded monthly calendar.
- **ScheduleX:** ScheduleX is an opensource calendar component that can be either embeded into a website, or used as a source-of-truth for a more robust integration that allows us to retain the current design while automating updates.
- **Zapier:** Automate event fetching to streamline updates without manual intervention.
- **Calendar Aggregators:** We could consider services like Teamup or Time.ly for comprehensive calendar management. However, this would not be as customizable as the other options.

I think Zapier could be a great option, allowing many users to automatically funnel their events into a single document, but I would also be open to discussing a full-stack custom solution. We've recently built a similar tool for a client and I think it would be a good starting point. I can provide more details if you'd like to discuss further.

Looking forward to your thoughts and feedback!

Hello Trent,

Thank you for your diligence on this task. Schedule X or Zapier seems as though they would be the best options, especially Zapier. However, I was wondering how you think a full stack custom solution could be better than it?

Best,

Hello Joshua,

Thank you for your feedback. I do believe integrating Zapier automations into each of the organization's pipelines would be a good solution. This way, each organization can manage their events independently, and the changes will be automatically reflected on the website.

In order to effectively implement Zapier into the Webflow site, I will need a few things from each of the organizations:

- A comprehensive list of the tools currently used for event management, along with the login credentials for their calendars.
- Their current workflow for event updates and any platform-specific integrations they already employ.
- Login credentials for each of the organizations' calendars will be needed when we're ready to implement the automations.

Let me know if you're able to provide this information, and I can start working on the integration. More information on how Zapier integrates with Webflow can be found here:

- Documentation: https://university.webflow.com/lesson/integrate-zapier?
- Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwxfoukJ8PA
- Zapier Pricing: https://zapier.com/app/planbuilder/plans

Regarding the full-stack custom solution as an alternative, there are several advantages to this approach that may be worth considering:

- **Compatability with Zapier:** By integrating Zapier with a custom frontend, we can leverage the best of both worlds—automating event data collection while providing a tailored user experience. This setup allows us to use Zapier's powerful automation capabilities to fetch and update event data automatically from various platforms, which can then be displayed through a custom interface designed specifically for the needs of each organization.
- **Flexibility:** We can design the user interface to match the existing aesthetic of our website seamlessly and integrate more deeply with our current systems.
- **Tailored Features:** We can implement custom features such as advanced filtering, user-specific notifications, and more sophisticated data analytics, which are often limited in off-the-shelf solutions.
- **Security:** Owning the codebase gives us control over data security and privacy, crucial for user trust and compliance with regulations. It also avoids ongoing subscription costs or changes in service terms that can occur with third-party services.
- **Reliability:** 3rd party service outages or discontinuations can be avoided by using a custom solution.
- **Cost-Effective:** We can avoid the ongoing costs and service terms that can occur with third-party services.

A custom solution could provide a more robust and sustainable framework for event management needs in the long run. If you agree, I would be happy to draft a more detailed proposal outlining the potential features, estimated costs, and development timeline.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,
Trent

Hello Trent,

I was speaking with the Executive Director about the two options. We would like an estimate on what the price difference would be depending on choosing Zapier versus going down the custom full stack solution route. Additionally, this is not relevant, but I'm curious which languages you would be using to create this full stack solution?

Best,

Joshua

# Trent's response to Joshua

Hey Joshua,

Happy Monday!

The app would be developed using Nuxt 3 on the frontend, PocketBase on the backend for real-time data sync, file storage and authentication, and ExpressJS for the API middleware.

The PocketBase backend would be hosted using PocketHost.io, and the frontend + API middleware would be hosted on Vercel.

This is the stack we use for all of our full-stack development projects at Gumbo.

Let me know if you have any questions. Happy to provide more information on our development process.

Best,
Trent

Hello Trent,

Happy Monday :)

I was wondering if you couple provide me with an estimated price difference on this full-stack option versus going with the Zapier route.

 Best,

Joshua

# Joshua's follow up to Trent (Diamond is CC'd)

I am adding the Executive Director to the email chain, as today was my last day. It has been nice discussing with you and thank you for all the help!

# Trent's response to Diamond and Joshua

Hello Team,

It's great to connect with you, @Diamond Dixon!

@Joshua, I want to clarify that both the Zapier integration and the full-stack custom option will be provided pro bono. There will be no additional costs involved, and the project's scope, including the allocated resources, will remain as initially agreed upon.

For a quick and efficient solution, I recommend we proceed with the Zapier integration. However, I also want to outline the implications of each choice clearly:

The development of the custom full-stack app represents a strategic exploration into the market need for federated-calendar solution, as identified through our collaboration with Bronzeville Blues Collaborative. Gumbo would design, develop, maintain, and potentially scale this custom solution, using Bronzeville Blues as a critical test-case to provide feedback and validation. On the other hand, the Zapier integration serves as a short-term solution to meet immediate needs.

If you're interested in discussing the full-stack option further, I'm ready to draft a detailed proposal that outlines potential features, the development process, and a timeline.

In any case, I can initiate the Zapier integration right away. I'll just need the previously mentioned information from each organization to proceed.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification. I'm happy to make any additional changes to the website as well in the meantime as we prepare for launch.

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Best,
Trent
