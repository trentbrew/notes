# Executive Summary

---

‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt a kid from Nashville be Wakandan? Why can‚Äôt an outsider be King? Why can‚Äôt Killmonger become Wakanda‚Äôs Protector? Why can‚Äôt a superhero be Black?‚Äù ~ Stephen J. Watts

- I am seeking **$20,000** to curate a multi-media magazine featuring an essay and additional visual art pieces created by Black Nashville-based artists.
- This magazine will be permanently hosted on a website built out specifically for this project, printed into 500 physical copies, and distributed at in-person events created to celebrate the work of all contributors to the project.
- **The goals of this project are to:**

    1. explore the relationship between Black Americans and other members of the African diaspora;

    2. imagine a world in which Black people would not have to be exceptional to be valued;

    3. create a new communal story centered on unconditional belonging and love.


# Project Goals

---

### Goal #1

If Wakanda is the Black Promised Land, then we are Her forgotten children. ~ Stephen J. Watts

Marvel Studios' Black Panther (2018) was a world-wide phenomenon because it was visual testimony to what Black people have always suspected, but do not yet have the tools to prove. That we are beautiful, that our lives matter, and we have a history beyond our present circumstance. That America has forced us into inhumane conditions does not mean we are inhuman. And yet, Black Panther relies on a number of unfortunate tropes to prove our humanness. Wakanda is an empire‚Äîand all empires are built on bones. The Black Panther has superhuman strength and reflexes‚Äîwhat hope is there for those of us who are not bulletproof? The only African-American character in the movie is the villain who must be killed in combat‚Äî suggesting that we are figuratively (and physically) scarred beyond redemption. These directorial choices hint at the awkward position African-Americans occupy within the Black diaspora.

### Goal #2

The Dream only provides comfort to those who can afford to be folded within it.  ~ Stephen J. Watts

The second goal of this project is to intentionally call into question the mythologies that Black people in America were raised on. These include, but are not limited to: white supremacy, rigid religiosity, physical punishment, respectability politics, Black capitalism, and white validation. I also intend to explore how depictions of Black empowerment in popular media tend to reinforce deeply-held societal beliefs that wealth, ownership, power, and personal achievement are the only possible pathways toward liberation.  This project draws heavily on the themes of Afro-futurism by imagining a world in which Black people would not have to be superheroes to be loved.

### Goal #3

Past our forced forgetting and our reinvention as property‚Äî against all odds, we have found ourselves here. ~ Stephen J. Watts

The third goal of this project is to explore alternatives to the "single story." The "single story" says this: I am a descendant of the most perfect people to have ever walked this earth; this is what makes me worthy. The "single story" is a myth that has been propagated by human beings since time began. However, white supremacy perfected the "single story" as an act of psychological warfare. In the face of an all-out attack against the accurate and holistic history of this country, it becomes a creative act of resistance to tell an alternative story of our past.
I have invited other Black Nashville-based artists to engage in an intimate recounting of their histories. While we as Black Americans may have been forcefully cut off from much of our ancestors' pasts, our miseducation and separation holds a story of its own. This project offers an opportunity to model what it means to be the descendants of an imperfect people and be present with our past.

Questions

</aside>

## Art Direction (general questions)

- I read that Spiderman is your favorite super hero. Is there anything about the style/aesthetic/etc of spiderman that ressonates with you?
    - [ ]  Yes! I love his ethos. He‚Äôs just a kid trying to do the right thing in a world that cannot honor good intentions. I also love his iconic suit. But what has blown my mind especially with the transition to Miles Morales is how easily his origin story is able to be transferred to another character and still retain the power and meaning of the original. Batman will always be Bruce Wayne. Spiderman can be anybody with a good heart and intentions and love for their city.
- Do you have a favorite villain? Who and why?
    - [ ]  I wish the answer was Killmonger, but the answer is Magneto. I love how Magneto points out the flaws in Professor X‚Äôs vision and is able to articulate his own vision, not as utopia, but as a place that gives a better chance for his people to survive. I do not agree with his vision, but I agree with his criticisms of Professor X, appreciate his own honesty about his pragmatism, and that this integrity gives a good insight into the motivations and intentions of the character.
- What is your relationship with manga|anime?
    - [ ]  I barely have one! I‚Äôve watched some of the bigger ones like My Hero or One Punch Man and enjoyed them. I love American anime like Avatar: The Last Airbender. I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôve seen ‚ÄúArcane‚Äù or if that counts as anime, but it‚Äôs so dope. In general I love how animated shows translate action and complicated relationships/subtle emotional beats easier than live tv shows. I‚Äôm currently watching Blue Eye Samurai and also am a big fan of Star Wars: The Clone Wars (animated but not anime).
- Do you have a favorite superhero film? (liveaction|animated) + why?
    - [ ]  Into the Spiderverse and the Incredibles (with the first Avengers barely behind). I feel like they don‚Äôt take any shortcuts with the characters and are honest about what it takes to grow into something greater than what you have currently allowed yourself to become. They are honest about the emotions of loss and how limiting beliefs can compromise your vision. They depict loss processed well as part of the whole, and therefore part of the character‚Äôs strength.
- Did you make up characters/stories/lore as a kid / with your siblings?
    - [ ]  All the time!!! We would write little plays or re-enact scenes from our favorite TV shows. I should find the pictures somewhere and see if these can be integrated someway into the project.
- Do you play videogames?
    - [ ]  Do you have a fav game? Why?
        - [ ]  My favorite game was Star Wars: Battle Ground. I loved playing with a villain like Darth Vader and seeing if there were any limits to his strength.
    - [ ]  Do you have a favorite era of videogames? Why?
        - [ ]  I didn‚Äôt play enough to know.
    - [ ]  Do you have a favorite genere of videogames? Why?
        - [ ]  Sports video games and open world games like GTA or Red Dead RRedemption. Sports video games because they imitated my life. Open world games because it felt like there was no limits to the imagination.

## Content

- How do you envision QR codes will be used between the physical & digital magazines?
    - [ ]  @Trent Brew I‚Äôd love to talk about this next week or the following. These are some of the things I‚Äôve thought about QR Codes
        - [ ]  Linking readers to relevant multi-media pieces that cannot be displayed well in a physical magazine
        - [ ]  Pointing folks toward artists‚Äô pages and opportunities to buy their work.
        - [ ]  Music? Other relevant supplemental information? Essays/books that inspired me? I‚Äôm not sure at what point linking to outside information is overwhelming and at what point it expands the world and connects folks to more ways to explore those ideas. Perhaps a reference page at the end of sections so that I can credit all the inspirations I had for the different letters or concepts? I‚Äôve been so inspired by writers like Baldwin, Ta-Nahesi Coates, Kiese Laymon, Bell Hooks, and others.
- **What other ways might we create cross-narratives & interactivity between physical & digital mediums? (XR?)**
- How do you envision the concept of Mundane Afro-futurism taking shape in the magazine?
- Thoughts on steampunk|cyberpunk|solarpunk|craftpunk|etc

## Physical Magazine

- How do you envision the differences between the physical and digital magazines? What might one have that the other doesn‚Äôt?
- What is something you would really like to see in the physical magazine that you‚Äôre afraid might not be possible?

## Digital Magazine

- Would you describe the digital magazine as more of ‚Äúa living breathing dynamic online community‚Äù, or ‚Äúa fixed archive of a specific number of stories & narratives‚Äù, or something else?
    - [ ]  An archive. But I would also like space on that same website that is updated with content from the experiential showcases. I wonder how I can have a magazine page that is also linked intuitively to the project page.
- What mediums of engagement (if any) do you envision for the digital magazine?
    - [ ]  I want more of your thoughts on this! I haven‚Äôt thought this through!
- Do you already own the domain?
    - [ ]  I own blackmythologyproject.com
- What is something you would really like to see in the digital magazine that you‚Äôre afraid might not be possible?
    - [ ]  There are definitely things! I will loop back on this

## Foundations

- Do you need help with designing/building slide decks & stuff?
    - [ ]  I think I should be good! But I will need help on a creative brief we should tap in about at some point.

## Monetization

- What are your thoughts on ads?
    - [ ]  I‚Äôve gone back and forth! I think I‚Äôm learning towards no‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm open to discuss.
- What are your thoughts on magazine subscriptions?
    - [ ]  I would love to discuss this!

## Outlook

- What happens after the magazine launch?
- Thoughts on the prospect of nurturing the beast
    - [ ]  I‚Äôm terrified of serving the project vs. the project serving the needs of community. Literally terrified. I hope this is a trap I can be conscious of and avoid to the best of my ability.
- Some next steps that have come up as options
    - [ ]  Curating spaces with pieces from the project
    - [ ]  Conducting workshops/community programming based on the concepts from the project (focused on collective memory as a healing modality)
    - [ ]  Creating curriculum based on the concepts from the project focused on high schools
        - [ ]  English Lit: How do we use mundane afro-futurism to create stories that reflect the inherent dignity and worth of us all? In a culture awash with anti-Blackness, even narratives meant to empower can be reflections of self-hatred rather than rooted in self-love. Mundane afro-futurism says that literary devices, even in science-fiction and fantasy, ought to be used to explore uniqueness of the Black experience, rather than an escape from them. This is a creative challenge to root stories in elements of our lived experience, rather than in the fantasies others hold for us (or the fantasies we hold for ourselves).
        - [ ]  History/Sociology: How do we use collective memory to find out new things about the past? What do we do with absences in the historical record? What opportunities for recovery exist in that Void?
